<h2>RELIGIO LAICI.</h2>


<p>The <cite>Religio Laici</cite>, according to Johnson, is almost the only
work of Dryden which can be considered as a voluntary effusion.
I do not see much ground for this assertion. Dryden was indeed
obliged to write by the necessity of his circumstances; but the
choice of the mode in which he was to labour was his own, as well
in his Fables and other poems, as in that which follows. Nay, upon
examination, the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> appears, in a great measure, a
controversial, and almost a political poem; and, being such, cannot
be termed, with propriety, a voluntary effusion, any more
than "The Medal," or "Absalom and Achitophel." It is evident,
Dryden had his own times in consideration, and the effect
which the poem was likely to produce upon them. Religious
controversy had mingled deeply with the party politics of the
reign of Charles II. Divided, as the nation was, into the three
great sects of Churchmen, Papists, and Dissenters, their several
creeds were examined by their antagonists with scrupulous malignity,
and every hint extracted from them which could be turned
to the disadvantage of those who professed them. To the Catholics,
the dissenters objected their cruel intolerance and jesuitical
practices; to the church of England, their servile dependence
on the crown, and slavish doctrine of non-resistance. The
Catholics, on the other hand, charged the reformed church of
England with desertion from the original doctrines of Christianity,
with denying the infallibility of general councils, and destroying
the unity of the church; and against the fanatics, they objected
their anti-monarchical tenets, the wild visions of their independent
preachers, and their seditious cabals against the church
and state. While the church of England was thus assailed by
two foes, who did not at the same time spare each other, it probably
occurred to Dryden, that he, who could explain her tenets
by a plain and philosophical commentary, had a chance, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of contributing to fix and regulate the faith of her professors, but
of reconciling to her, as the middle course, the Catholics and the
fanatics. The Duke of York and the Papists, on the one hand,
were urging the king to the most desperate measures; on the
other, the popular faction were just not in arms. The king, with
the assistance and advice of Halifax, was trimming his course betwixt
these outrageous and furious torrents. Whatever, therefore,
at this important crisis, might act as a sedative on the inflamed
spirits of all parties, and encourage them to abide with patience
the events of futurity, was a main point in favour of the
crown. A rational and philosophical view of the tenets of the national
church, liberally expressed, and decorated with the ornaments
of poetry, seemed calculated to produce this effect; and as I have
no doubt, as well from the preface, as from passages in the poem,
that Dryden had such a purpose in view, I have ventured to place
the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> among his historical and political poems.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I would not, from what is above stated, be understood to mean,
that Dryden wrote this poem merely with a view to politics, and
that he was himself sceptical in the matters of which it treats.&mdash;On
the contrary, I have no doubt, that it expresses, without disguise
or reservation, what was then the author's serious and firm,
though, as it unfortunately proved, not his unalterable religious
opinion. The remarkable line in the "Hind and Panther,"
seems to refer to the state of his mind at this period; and this system
of divinity was among the "new sparkles which his pride
had struck forth," after he had abandoned the fanatical doctrines
in which he was doubtless educated.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is therefore probable, that,
having formed for himself, on grounds which seemed to warrant
it, a rational exposition of the national creed, he was willing to
communicate it to the public at a period, when moderation of religious
zeal was so essentially necessary to the repose of the nation.</p>

<p>Considered in this point of view, the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> is one of
the most admirable poems in the language. The argumentative
part is conducted with singular skill, upon those topics which occasioned
the principal animosity between the religious sects; and
the deductions are drawn in favour of the church of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with so much apparent impartiality, that those who could not assent,
had at least no title to be angry. The opinions of the various
classes of free-thinkers are combated by an appeal to those
feelings of the human mind, which always acknowledge an offended
Deity, and to the various modes in which all ages and nations
have shewn their sense of the necessity of an atonement by
sacrifice and penance. Dryden, however, differs from most philosophers,
who suppose this consciousness of guilt to be originally
implanted in our bosoms: he, somewhat fantastically, argues,
as if it were some remnants of the original faith revealed to Noah,
and preserved by the posterity of Shem. The inadequacy of sacrifices
and oblations, when compared with the crimes of those by whom
they are made, and with the grandeur of the omnipotent Being, to
whom they are offered, paves the way for the imputed righteousness
of Jesus Christ, the fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion.
The fitness of this vicarious sacrifice to accomplish the redemption
of man, and vindicate the justice and mercy of God; the
obvious impossibility that the writings, or authors, by which it
has been conveyed to us, should be less than inspired; the progress
of the Christian faith itself, though militating against the
corrupt dispositions of humanity, and graced with none of those
attractions by which Mahomet, and other false prophets, bribed
their followers, are then successively urged as evidences of the
Christian religion. The poet then recurs to an objection, at which
he had hinted in his preface. If the Christian religion is necessary
to salvation, why is it not extended to all nations of the
earth? And suppose we grant that the circumstance of the revealed
religion having been formerly preached and embraced in
great part of the world where it is now unknown, shall be sufficient
to subject those regions to be judged by its laws, what is
to become of the generations who have lived before the coming
of the Messiah? what of the inhabitants of those countries on
which the beams of the gospel have never shone? To these doubts,
I hope most Christians will think our author returns a liberal,
and not a presumptuous answer, in supposing that the heathen will
be judged according to the light which it has pleased God to afford
them; and that, infinitely less fortunate than us in the extent
of their spiritual knowledge, they will only be called upon to answer
for their conformity with the dictates of their own conscience.
The authority of St Athanasius our author here sets aside, either
because in the ardour of his dispute with Arius he carried
his doctrine too far, or because his creed only has reference
to the decision of a doctrinal question in the Christian church;
and the anathema annexed applies not to the heathen world, but
to those, who, having heard the orthodox faith preached, have wilfully
chosen the heresy. Dryden next takes under review the
work of Father Simon; and, after an eulogy on the author and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
translator, pronounces, that the former was not a bigotted Catholic,
since he did not hesitate to challenge some of the traditions
of the church of Rome. To these traditions, these "brushwood
helps," with which the Catholics endeavoured to fence the doctrines
of their church, our author proceeds, and throws them
aside as liable to error and corruption. The pretensions of the
church of Rome, by her pope and general councils, infallibly to
determine the authenticity of church tradition, is the next proposition.
To this the poet answers, that if they possess infallibility
at all, it ought to go the length of restoring the canon, or correcting
the corrupt copies of scripture; a reply which seems to
concede to the Romans; as, without denying the grounds of their
claim, it only asserts, that it is not sufficiently extended. Upon,
the ground, however, that the plea of infallibility, by which the
poet is obviously somewhat embarrassed, must be dismissed, as
proving too much, the holy scriptures are referred to as the sole
rule of faith; admitting such explanations as the church of England
has given to the contested doctrines of Christianity. The unlettered
Christian, we are told, does well to pursue, in simplicity, his path
to heaven; the learned divine is to study well the sacred scriptures,
with such assistance as the most early traditions of the church,
especially those which are written, may, in doubtful points, afford
him. It is in this argument chiefly, that there may be traced
a sort of vacillation and uncertainty in our author's opinion,
boding what afterwards took place&mdash;his acquiescence in the
church authority of Rome. Nevertheless, having vaguely pronounced,
that some traditions are to be received, and others rejected,
he gives his opinion against the Roman see, which dictated to
the laity the explications of doctrine as adopted by the church, and
prohibited them to form their own opinion upon the text, or even
to peruse the sacred volume which contains it. This Dryden
contrasts with the opposite evil, of vulgar enthusiasts debasing
scripture by their own absurd commentaries, and dividing into as
many sects, as there are wayward opinions formed upon speculative
doctrine. He concludes, that both extremes are to be
avoided; that saving faith does not depend on nice disquisitions;
yet, if inquisitive minds are hurried into such, the scripture, and
the commentary of the fathers, are their only safe guides:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And after hearing what our church can say,</div>
  <div class="i0">If still our reason runs another way,</div>
  <div class="i0">That private reason 'tis more just to curb,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than by disputes the public peace disturb;</div>
  <div class="i0">For points obscure are of small use to learn,</div>
  <div class="i0">But common quiet is mankind's concern.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In considering Dryden's creed thus analyzed, I think it will appear,
that the author, though still holding the doctrines of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
church of England, had been biassed, in the course of his enquiry,
by those of Rome. His wish for the possibility of an infallible
guide,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> expressed with almost indecent ardour, the difficulty,
nay, it would seem, in his estimation, almost the impossibility,
of discriminating between corrupted and authentic traditions,
while the necessity of the latter to the interpretation of scripture
is plainly admitted, appear, upon the whole, to have left the
poet's mind in an unpleasing state of doubt, from which he rather
escapes than is relieved. He who only acquiesces in the doctrines
of his church, because the exercise of his private judgement
may disturb the tranquillity of the state, can hardly be said
to be in a state to give a reason for the faith that is in him.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> is admirably adapted to the
subject: though treating of the most abstruse doctrines of Christianity,
it is as clear and perspicuous as the most humble prose,
while it has all the elegance and effect which argument is capable of
receiving from poetry. Johnson, usually sufficiently niggard of
praise, has allowed, that this "is a composition of great excellence
in its kind, in which the familiar is very properly diversified
with the solemn, and the grave with the humorous; in which
metre has neither weakened the force, nor clouded the perspicuity
of argument; nor will it be easy to find another example, equally
happy, of this middle kind of writing, which, though prosaic
in some parts, rises to high poetry in others, and neither towers to
the skies, nor creeps along the ground."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I cannot help remarking,
that the style of the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> has been imitated successfully
by the late Mr Cowper in some of his pieces. Yet he has
not been always able to maintain the resemblance, but often
crawls where Dryden would have walked. The natural dignity
of our author may be discovered in the lamest lines of the
poem, whereas his imitator is often harsh and embarrassed. Both
are occasionally prosaic; but in such passages Dryden's verse resembles
good prose, and Cowper's that which is feeble and involved.</p>

<p>The name which Dryden has thought proper to affix to this
declaration of his faith, seems to have been rather fashionable
about that time. There is a treatise <cite>de Religione Laici</cite>, attached
to the work of Lord Herbert of Cherburg, <cite>De Veritate</cite>, first
published in 1633. But the most famous work, with a similar
title, was the <cite>Religio Medici</cite> of Thomas Browne, which was translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
into Latin by Meryweather, and afterwards into French,
Italian, Dutch, German, and most of the languages of Europe.
In 1683, Charles Blount, of Staffordshire, son to Sir Henry
Blount, published a short treatise, entitled, <cite>Religio Laici</cite>, which
he inscribed to his "much honoured friend, John Dryden,
Esq.;" whom he informed, in the epistle-dedicatory, "I have
endeavoured that my discourse should only be a continuance of
yours; and that, as you taught men how to believe, so I might instruct
them how to live."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested, that the purpose of the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> of
Dryden was to bring the contending factions to sober and philosophical
reflection on their differences in points of faith, and to
abate, if possible, the acrimony with which they contended upon
the most obscure subjects of polemical divinity. But to attempt,
by an abstracted disquisition on the original cause of quarrel, to
stop a controversy, in which all the angry passions had been
roused, and which indeed was fast verging towards blows, is as vain
an attempt, as it would be to turn the course of a river, swoln
with a thousand tributary streams, by draining the original spring-head.
From the cold reception of this poem, compared to those
political and personal satires which preceded it, Dryden might
learn the difference of interest, excited by productions which
tended to fan party rage, and one which was designed to mitigate
its ferocity. The <cite>Religio Laici</cite>, which first appeared in November
1682, neither attracted admiration nor censure; it was neither
hailed by the acclamations of the one party, nor attacked by
the indignant answers of the other. The public were, however,
sufficiently interested in it to call for a renewal of the impression
in the following year. This second edition, which had escaped
even the researches of Mr Malone, is in the collection of my friend
Mr Heber. It might probably have been again reprinted with advantage,
but our author's change of faith must necessarily have
rendered him unwilling to give a third edition. The same circumstance
called the attention of his enemies towards this neglected
poem, who, in many libels, upbraided him with the versatility of
his religious opinions. The author of a pamphlet, called "The
Revolter," was at the pains to print the tenets of the <cite>Religio
Laici</cite> concerning the Catholic controversy, in contrast with those
which our author had adopted and expressed in the "Hind and
Panther."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Another turned our author's own title against him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and published "<cite>Religio Laici</cite>, or a Layman's Faith touching the
Supream and Infallible Guide of the Church, by J. R. a Convert
of Mr Bayes. In Two Letters to a Friend in the Country. Licenced
June the 1st, 1688." In both these pamphlets our author is treated
with the grossest insolence and brutality.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Excepting these malignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
criticisms, the <cite>Religio Laici</cite> slept in obscurity after the second
edition, and was not again published till after the author's
death. Neither has it been since popular, although its pure spirit
of Christianity should be acceptable to the religious, its moderation
to the philosopher, and the excellence of the composition
to all admirers of argumentative poetry.</p>

<h2><span class="small50">THE</span><br />

<a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r5a" />

<p><span class="fontsize">A</span> <span class="smcap">Poem</span>, with so bold a title, and a name prefixed
from which the handling of so serious a subject
would not be expected, may reasonably oblige the
author to say somewhat in defence, both of himself
and of his undertaking. In the first place, if it be
objected to me, that, being a layman, I ought not to
have concerned myself with speculations, which
belong to the profession of divinity; I could answer,
that perhaps laymen, with equal advantages of
parts and knowledge, are not the most incompetent
judges of sacred things; but, in the due sense of
my own weakness, and want of learning, I plead
not this; I pretend not to make myself a judge of
faith in others, but only to make a confession of my
own. I lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark, but
wait on it, with the reverence that becomes me, at
a distance. In the next place, I will ingenuously
confess, that the helps I have used in this small
treatise, were many of them taken from the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of our own reverend divines of the church of England;
so that the weapons with which I combat irreligion,
are already consecrated; though I suppose
they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword
of Goliah was by David, when they are to be employed
for the common cause against the enemies
of piety. I intend not by this to entitle them to
any of my errors, which yet I hope are only those
of charity to mankind; and such as my own charity
has caused me to commit, that of others may
more easily excuse. Being naturally inclined to
scepticism in philosophy, I have no reason to impose
my opinions in a subject which is above it;
but whatever they are, I submit them with all reverence
to my mother church, accounting them no
further mine, than as they are authorised, or at
least uncondemned, by her. And, indeed, to secure
myself on this side, I have used the necessary precaution
of shewing this paper before it was published
to a judicious and learned friend; a man indefatigably
zealous in the service of the church and
state, and whose writings have highly deserved of
both. He was pleased to approve the body of the
discourse, and I hope he is more my friend than to
do it out of complaisance: It is true, he had too
good a taste to like it all; and, amongst some other
faults, recommended to my second view, what I
have written, perhaps too boldly, on St Athanasius,
which he advised me wholly to omit. I am sensible
enough, that I had done more prudently to have
followed his opinion; but then I could not have satisfied
myself, that I had done honestly not to have
written what was my own. It has always been
my thought, that heathens, who never did, nor
without miracle could, hear of the name of Christ,
were yet in a possibility of salvation. Neither will
it enter easily into my belief, that before the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of our Saviour, the whole world, excepting
only the Jewish nation, should lie under the inevitable
necessity of everlasting punishment, for want
of that revelation, which was confined to so small
a spot of ground as that of Palestine. Among the
sons of Noah, we read of one only who was accursed;
and, if a blessing, in the ripeness of time, was
reserved for Japhet, of whose progeny we are, it
seems unaccountable to me, why so many generations
of the same offspring, as preceded our Saviour
in the flesh, should be all involved in one common
condemnation, and yet that their posterity should
be entitled to the hopes of salvation; as if a bill of
exclusion had passed only on the fathers, which debarred
not the sons from their succession: or, that
so many ages had been delivered over to hell, and
so many reserved for heaven, and that the devil had
the first choice, and God the next. Truly I am apt
to think, that the revealed religion, which was
taught by Noah to all his sons, might continue for
some ages in the whole posterity. That afterwards
it was included wholly in the family of Shem, is manifest;
but when the progenies of Cham and Japhet
swarmed into colonies, and those colonies were
subdivided into many others, in process of time
their descendants lost, by little and little, the primitive
and purer rites of divine worship, retaining
only the notion of one deity; to which succeeding
generations added others; for men took their degrees
in those ages from conquerors to gods. Revelation
being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind,
the light of nature, as the next in dignity, was substituted;
and that is it which St Paul concludes to
be the rule of the heathens, and by which they are
hereafter to be judged. If my supposition be true,
then the consequence, which I have assumed in my
poem, may be also true; namely, that Deism, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the principles of natural worship, are only faint
remnants, or dying flames, of revealed religion, in
the posterity of Noah; and that our modern philosophers,
nay, and some of our philosophising divines,
have too much exalted the faculties of our
souls, when they have maintained, that, by their
force, mankind has been able to find out, that there
is one supreme agent, or intellectual being, which
we call God; that praise and prayer are his due
worship; and the rest of those deducements, which
I am confident are the remote effects of revelation,
and unattainable by our discourse, I mean as simply
considered, and without the benefit of divine illumination.
So that we have not lifted up ourselves
to God, by the weak pinions of our reason, but he
has been pleased to descend to us; and what Socrates
said of him, what Plato writ, and the rest of
the heathen philosophers of several nations, is all no
more than the twilight of revelation, after the sun
of it was set in the race of Noah. That there is
something above us, some principle of motion, our
reason can apprehend, though it cannot discover
what it is by its own virtue: and, indeed, it is
very improbable that we, who, by the strength of
our faculties, cannot enter into the knowledge of
any being, not so much as of our own, should be
able to find out, by them, that supreme nature,
which we cannot otherwise define, than by saying
it is infinite; as if infinite were definable, or infinity
a subject for our narrow understanding. They,
who would prove religion by reason, do but weaken
the cause which they endeavour to support: it is to
take away the pillars from our faith, and to prop it
only with a twig; it is to design a tower, like that
of Babel, which, if it were possible, as it is not, to
reach heaven, would come to nothing by the confusion
of the workmen. For every man is building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a several way; impotently conceited of his own
model and his own materials, reason is always striving,
and always at a loss; and of necessity it must
so come to pass, while it is exercised about that
which is not its proper object. Let us be content, at
last, to know God by his own methods; at least,
so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in
the sacred Scriptures. To apprehend them to be the
word of God is all our reason has to do; for all
beyond it is the work of faith, which is the seal of
heaven impressed upon our human understanding.</p>

<p>And now for what concerns the holy Bishop
Athanasius, the preface of whose creed seems inconsistent
with my opinion, which is, that heathens
may possibly be saved. In the first place, I
desire it may be considered, that it is the preface
only, not the creed itself, which, till I am better
informed, is of too hard a digestion for my charity.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It is not that I am ignorant, how many several
texts of Scripture seemingly support that cause;
but neither am I ignorant, how all those texts may
receive a kinder, and more mollified interpretation.
Every man, who is read in church history, knows
that belief was drawn up after a long contestation
with Arius, concerning the divinity of our blessed
Saviour, and his being one substance with the Father;
and that thus compiled, it was sent abroad
among the Christian churches, as a kind of test,
which, whosoever took, was looked on as an orthodox
believer.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is manifest from hence, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
heathen part of the empire was not concerned in
it; for its business was not to distinguish betwixt
Pagans and Christians, but betwixt heretics and
true believers. This, well considered, takes off the
heavy weight of censure, which I would willingly
avoid from so venerable a man; for if this proportion,
"whosoever will be saved," be restrained only
to those to whom it was intended, and for whom it
was composed, I mean the Christians; then the
anathema reaches not the heathens, who had never
heard of Christ, and were nothing interested in that
dispute. After all, I am far from blaming even
that prefatory addition to the creed, and as far
from cavilling at the continuation of it in the liturgy
of the church, where, on the days appointed,
it is publicly read: for I suppose there is the
same reason for it now, in opposition to the Socinians,
as there was then against the Arians; the one
being a heresy, which seems to have been refined
out of the other; and with how much more plausibility
of reason it combats our religion, with so
much more caution it ought to be avoided: therefore,
the prudence of our church is to be commended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which has interposed her authority for the recommendation
of this creed. Yet to such as are
grounded in the true belief, those explanatory
creeds, the Nicene and this of Athanasius, might
perhaps be spared; for what is supernatural will
always be a mystery in spite of exposition; and,
for my own part, the plain Apostles creed is most
suitable to my weak understanding, as the simplest
diet is the most easy of digestion.</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer on this subject than I intended,
and longer than perhaps I ought; for, having
laid down, as my foundation, that the Scripture
is a rule; that in all things needful to salvation
it is clear, sufficient, and ordained by God Almighty
for that purpose; I have left myself no right
to interpret obscure places, such as concern the
possibility of eternal happiness to heathens; because
whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary
to be known.</p>

<p>But, by asserting the Scripture to be the canon
of our faith, I have unavoidably created to myself
two sorts of enemies; the papists, indeed, more directly,
because they have kept the Scripture from
us what they could, and have reserved to themselves
a right of interpreting what they have delivered under
the pretence of infallibility; and the fanatics,
more collaterally, because they have assumed what
amounts to an infallibility in the private spirit, and
have distorted those texts of Scripture which are
not necessary to salvation, to the damnable uses of
sedition, disturbance, and destruction of the civil
government. To begin with the papists, and to
speak freely, I think them the less dangerous (at
least in appearance) to our present state; for not only
the penal laws are in force against them, and their
number is contemptible, but also their peerage and
commons are excluded from parliaments, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
those laws in no probability of being repealed.
A general and uninterrupted plot of their
clergy, ever since the Reformation, I suppose all
protestants believe; for it is not reasonable to think,
but that so many of their orders, as were outed
from their fat possessions, would endeavour a re-entrance
against those whom they account heretics.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
As for the late design, Mr Coleman's letters,
for aught I know, are the best evidence; and
what they discover, without wire-drawing their
sense, or malicious glosses, all men of reason conclude
credible.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If there be any thing more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this required of me, I must believe it as well as I
am able, in spite of the witnesses, and out of a decent
conformity to the votes of parliament; for I
suppose the fanatics will not allow the private spirit
in this case. Here the infallibility is at least in one
part of the government; and our understandings,
as well as our wills, are represented. But, to return
to the Roman Catholics, how can we be secure
from the practice of jesuited papists in that religion?
For not two or three of that order, as some
of them would impose upon us, but almost the
whole body of them, are of opinion, that their infallible
master has a right over kings, not only in
spirituals, but temporals. Not to name Mariana,
Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Molina, Santarel, Simancha,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and at least twenty others of foreign countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
we can produce of our own nation, Campian,
and Doleman or Parsons,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> (besides many [who] are
named whom I have not read,) who all of them attest
this doctrine, that the pope can depose and
give away the right of any sovereign prince, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">si vel
paulum deflexerit</i>, if he shall never so little warp;
but if he once comes to be excommunicated, then
the bond of obedience is taken off from subjects;
and they may and ought to drive him, like another
Nebuchadnezzar, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex hominum Christianorum
dominatu</i>, from exercising dominion over Christians;
and to this they are bound by virtue of
divine precept, and by all the ties of conscience,
under no less penalty than damnation. If they answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
me, (as a learned priest has lately written,) that
this doctrine of the Jesuits is not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de fide</i>, and that
consequently they are not obliged by it, they must
pardon me, if I think they have said nothing to
the purpose; for it is a maxim in their church,
where points of faith are not decided, and that doctors
are of contrary opinions, they may follow which
part they please, but more safely the most received
and most authorized. And their champion, Bellarmine,
has told the world, in his Apology, that the
king of England is a vassal to the pope, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ratione, directi
dominii</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and that he holds in villanage of
his Roman landlord; which is no new claim put
in for England: our chronicles are his authentic
witnesses, that King John was deposed by the
same plea, and Philip Augustus admitted tenant;
and, which makes the more for Bellarmine, the
French king was again ejected when our king submitted
to the church, and the crown received under
the sordid condition of a vassalage.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient for the more moderate and
well-meaning papists, of which I doubt not there
are many, to produce the evidences of their loyalty
to the late king, and to declare their innocency in
this plot. I will grant their behaviour in the first
to have been as loyal and as brave as they desire;
and will be willing to hold them excused as to the
second, (I mean when it comes to my turn, and after
my betters; for it is a madness to be sober
alone, while the nation continues drunk:) but that
saying of their father Cres.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is still running in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
head,&mdash;that they may be dispensed with in their obedience
to an heretic prince, while the necessity of
the times shall oblige them to it; (for that, as another
of them tells us, is only the effect of Christian
prudence;) but when once they shall get power to
shake him off, an heretic is no lawful king, and
consequently to rise against him is no rebellion. I
should be glad, therefore, that they would follow
the advice which was charitably given them by a
reverend prelate of our church, namely, that they
would join in a public act of disowning and detesting
those jesuitic principles, and subscribe to all
doctrines which deny the pope's authority of deposing
kings, and releasing subjects from their oath
of allegiance; to which, I should think, they might
easily be induced, if it be true, that this present
pope has condemned the doctrine of king-killing;
a thesis of the Jesuits, maintained, amongst others,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedra</i>, as they call it, or in open consistory.</p>

<p>Leaving them, therefore, in so fair a way, (if they
please themselves,) of satisfying all reasonable men
of their sincerity and good meaning to the government,
I shall make bold to consider that other extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of our religion, I mean the fanatics, or schismatics,
of the English church. Since the Bible has
been translated into our tongue, they have used it
so, as if their business was not to be saved, but to
be damned by its contents. If we consider only
them, better had it been for the English nation,
that it had still remained in the original Greek and
Hebrew, or at least in the honest Latin of St Jerome,
than that several texts in it should have been

<p>How many heresies the first translation of Tyndal<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
produced in few years, let my Lord Herbert's
History of Henry the Eighth inform you; insomuch
that, for the gross errors in it, and the great
mischiefs it occasioned, a sentence passed on the
first edition of the Bible, too shameful almost to be
repeated.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> After the short reign of Edward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a><br /><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Sixth, (who had continued to carry on the Reformation
on other principles than it was begun,) every
one knows, that not only the chief promoters of
that work, but many others, whose consciences
would not dispense with popery, were forced, for
fear of persecution, to change climates; from whence
returning at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's
reign, many of them, who had been in France, and
at Geneva, brought back the rigid opinions and
imperious discipline of Calvin, to graft upon our
Reformation;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which, though they cunningly concealed
at first, (as well knowing how nauseously
that drug would go down in a lawful monarchy,
which was prescribed for a rebellious commonwealth,)
yet they always kept it in reserve; and
were never wanting to themselves, either in court
or parliament, when either they had any prospect
of a numerous party of fanatic members in the one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
or the encouragement of any favourite in the other,
whose covetousness was gaping at the patrimony
of the church. They who will consult the works
of our venerable Hooker,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or the account of his
life, or more particularly the letter written to him
on this subject, by George Cranmer,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> may see by
what gradations they proceeded; from the dislike
of cap and surplice, the very next step was admonitions
to the parliament against the whole government
ecclesiastical; then came out volumes in English
and Latin in defence of their tenets; and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
practices were set on foot to erect their
discipline without authority. Those not succeeding,
satire and railing was the next; and Martin
Mar-prelate,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> (the Marvel of those times,) was the
first presbyterian scribbler, who sanctified libels and
scurrility to the use of the good old cause: which
was done, (says my author,) upon this account,
that their serious treatises having been fully answered
and refuted, they might compass by railing what
they had lost by reasoning; and, when their cause
was sunk in court and parliament, they might at
least hedge in a stake amongst the rabble, for to
their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive;
but if church and state were made the theme,
then the doctoral degree of wit was to be taken at
Billingsgate; even the most saintlike of the party,
though they durst not excuse this contempt and
vilifying of the government, yet were pleased, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
grinned at it with a pious smile, and called it a
judgment of God against the hierarchy. Thus sectaries,
we may see, were born with teeth, foul-mouthed,
and scurrilous from their infancy; and if
spiritual pride, venom, violence, contempt of superiors,
and slander, had been the marks of orthodox
belief, the presbytery, and the rest of our schismatics,
which are their spawn, were always the
most visible church in the Christian world.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It is true, the government was too strong at that
time for a rebellion; but, to shew what proficiency
they had made in Calvin's school, even then their
mouths watered at it; for two of their gifted brotherhood,
Hacket and Coppinger, as the story tells
us, got up in a pease-cart and harangued the people,
to dispose them to an insurrection, and to establish
their discipline by force;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> so that, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it comes about, that now they celebrate Queen
Elizabeth's birth-night, as that of their saint and
patroness; yet then they were for doing the work
of the Lord by arms against her;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and in all probability
they wanted but a fanatic lord-mayor, and
two sheriffs of their party, to have compassed it.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Our venerable Hooker, after many admonitions
which he had given them, towards the end of his
preface, breaks out into this prophetic speech:
"There is in every one of these considerations most
just cause to fear, lest our hastiness to embrace a
thing of so perilous consequence, (meaning the presbyterian
discipline,) should cause posterity to feel
those evils, which as yet are more easy for us to
prevent, than they would be for them to remedy."</p>

<p>How fatally this Cassandra has foretold, we know
too well by sad experience. The seeds were sown
in the time of Queen Elizabeth; the bloody harvest
ripened in the reign of King Charles the Martyr;
and, because all the sheaves could not be carried off
without shedding some of the loose grains, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
crop is too like to follow; nay, I fear it is unavoidable,
if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter.</p>

<p>A man may be suffered to quote an adversary to
our religion, when he speaks truth; and it is the
observation of Maimbourg,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in his "History of Calvinism,"
that wherever that discipline was planted
and embraced, rebellion, civil war, and misery, attended
it. And how indeed should it happen otherwise?
Reformation of church and state has always
been the ground of our divisions in England. While
we were papists, our Holy Father rid us, by pretending
authority out of the Scriptures to depose princes;
when we shook off his authority, the sectaries
furnished themselves with the same weapons, and
out of the same magazine, the Bible; so that the
Scriptures, which are in themselves the greatest security
of governors, as commanding express obedience
to them, are now turned to their destruction;
and never since the Reformation has there wanted
a text of their interpreting to authorize a rebel. And
it is to be noted by the way, that the doctrines of
king-killing and deposing, which have been taken
up only by the worst party of the Papists, the most
frontless flatterers of the pope's authority, have
been espoused, defended, and are still maintained,
by the whole body of nonconformists and republicans.
It is but dubbing themselves the people of
God, which it is the interest of their preachers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tell them they are, and their own interest to believe,
and after that, they cannot dip into the Bible,
but one text or another will turn up for their purpose:
if they are under persecution, as they call it,
then that is a mark of their election; if they flourish,
then God works miracles for their deliverance,
and the saints are to possess the earth.</p>

<p>They may think themselves to be too roughly
handled in this paper; but I, who know best how
far I could have gone on this subject, must be bold
to tell them, they are spared; though, at the same
time, I am not ignorant, that they interpret the
mildness of a writer to them, as they do the mercy
of the government; in the one they think it fear,
and conclude it weakness in the other. The best
way for them to confute me is, as I before advised
the Papists, to disclaim their principles, and renounce
their practices. We shall all be glad to
think them true Englishmen, when they obey the
king; and true Protestants, when they conform to
the church-discipline.</p>

<p>It remains that I acquaint the reader, that the
verses were written for an ingenious young gentleman,
my friend, upon his translation of "The Critical
History of the Old Testament," composed by
the learned father Simon:<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the verses, therefore,
are addressed to the translator of that work, and
the style of them is, what it ought to be, epistolary.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>If any one be so lamentable a critic as to require
the smoothness, the numbers, and the turn of heroic
poetry in this poem, I must tell him, that if
he has not read Horace, I have studied him, and
hope the style of his epistles is not ill imitated here.
The expressions of a poem, designed purely for instruction,
ought to be plain and natural, and yet
majestic; for here the poet is presumed to be a kind
of lawgiver, and those three qualities, which I have
named, are proper to the legislative style. The
florid, elevated, and figurative way, is for the passions;
for love and hatred, fear and anger, are begotten
in the soul, by shewing their objects out of
their true proportion, either greater than the life,
or less; but instruction is to be given by shewing
them what they naturally are. A man is to be
cheated into passion, but to be reasoned into truth.</p>

  <div class="i0">But vanished from them like enchanted ground.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">One thought content the good to be enjoyed;</div>
  <div class="i0">This every little accident destroyed:</div>
  <div class="i0">The wiser madmen did for virtue toil,</div>
  <div class="i0">A thorny, or, at best, a barren soil:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">In pleasure some their glutton souls would steep;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">But found their line too short, the well too deep,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And leaky vessels which no bliss could keep.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Thus anxious thoughts in endless circles roll,</div>
  <div class="i0">Without a centre where to fix the soul:</div>
  <div class="i0">In this wild maze their vain endeavours end:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">How can the less the greater comprehend?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or finite reason reach infinity?</div>
  <div class="i0">For what could fathom God were more than he.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Deist thinks he stands on firmer ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Cries ἔυρεκα! the mighty secret's found:</div>
  <div class="i0">God is that spring of good, supreme and best,</div>
  <div class="i0">We made to serve, and in that service blest;</div>
  <div class="i0">If so, some rules of worship must be given,</div>
  <div class="i0">Distributed alike to all by heaven;</div>
  <div class="i0">Else God were partial, and to some denied</div>
  <div class="i0">The means his justice should for all provide.</div>
  <div class="i0">This general worship is to praise and pray;</div>
  <div class="i0">One part to borrow blessings, one to pay;</div>
  <div class="i0">And when frail nature slides into offence,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sacrifice for crimes is penitence.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Yet since the effects of providence, we find,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are variously dispensed to human kind;</div>
  <div class="i0">That vice triumphs, and virtue suffers here,</div>
  <div class="i0">A brand that sovereign justice cannot bear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Our reason prompts us to a future state,</div>
  <div class="i0">The last appeal from fortune and from fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where God's all righteous ways will be declared;</div>
  <div class="i0">The bad meet punishment, the good reward.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus man by his own strength to heaven would soar,</div>
  <div class="i0">And would not be obliged to God for more.</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain wretched creature, how art thou misled,</div>
  <div class="i0">To think thy wit these god-like notions bred!</div>
  <div class="i0">These truths are not the product of thy mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">But dropt from heaven, and of a nobler kind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Revealed religion first informed thy sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And reason saw not till faith sprung the light.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hence all thy natural worship takes the source;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis revelation what thou think'st discourse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Else how com'st thou to see these truths so clear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which so obscure to heathens did appear?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not Plato these, nor Aristotle found,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor he whose wisdom oracles renowned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hast thou a wit so deep, or so sublime,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or canst thou lower dive, or higher climb?</div>
  <div class="i0">Canst thou by reason more of godhead know</div>
  <div class="i0">Than Plutarch, Seneca, or Cicero?</div>
  <div class="i0">Those giant wits, in happier ages born,</div>
  <div class="i0">When arms and arts did Greece and Rome adorn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Knew no such system; no such piles could raise</div>
  <div class="i0">Of natural worship, built on prayer and praise</div>
  <div class="i0">To one sole God;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor did remorse to expiate sin prescribe,</div>
  <div class="i0">But slew their fellow-creatures for a bribe:</div>
  <div class="i0">The guiltless victim groaned for their offence,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cruelty and blood was penitence.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">If sheep and oxen could atone for men,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ah! at how cheap a rate the rich might sin!</div>
  <div class="i0">And great oppressors might heaven's wrath beguile,</div>
  <div class="i0">By offering his own creatures for a spoil!</div>
  <div class="i0">Darest thou, poor worm, offend Infinity?</div>
  <div class="i0">And must the terms of peace be given by thee?</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thou art justice in the last appeal;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy easy God instructs thee to rebel;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, like a king remote and weak, must take</div>
  <div class="i0">What satisfaction thou art pleased to make.</div>
  <div class="i1">But if there be a Power too just and strong,</div>
  <div class="i0">To wink at crimes, and bear unpunished wrong;</div>
  <div class="i0">Look humbly upward, see his will disclose</div>
  <div class="i0">The forfeit first, and then the fine impose;</div>
  <div class="i0">A mulct thy poverty could never pay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had not Eternal Wisdom found the way,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with celestial wealth supplied thy store;</div>
  <div class="i0">His justice makes the fine, his mercy quits the score.</div>
  <div class="i0">See God descending in thy human frame;</div>
  <div class="i0">The offended suffering in the offender's name;</div>
  <div class="i0">All thy misdeeds to him imputed see,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all his righteousness devolved on thee.</div>
  <div class="i1">For, granting we have sinned, and that the offence</div>
  <div class="i0">Of man is made against Omnipotence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Some price that bears proportion must be paid.</div>
  <div class="i0">And infinite with infinite be weighed.</div>
  <div class="i0">See then the Deist lost: remorse for vice</div>
  <div class="i0">Not paid, or paid inadequate in price:</div>
  <div class="i0">What farther means can reason now direct,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or what relief from human wit expect?</div>
  <div class="i0">That shews us sick; and sadly are we sure</div>
  <div class="i0">Still to be sick, till heaven reveal the cure:</div>
  <div class="i0">If then heaven's will must needs be understood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which must, if we want cure, and heaven be good,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let all records of will revealed be shown;</div>
  <div class="i0">With scripture all in equal balance thrown,</div>
  <div class="i0">And our one sacred Book will be that one.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Proof needs not here; for, whether we compare</div>
  <div class="i0">That impious, idle, superstitious ware</div>
  <div class="i0">Of rites, lustrations, offerings, which before,</div>
  <div class="i0">In various ages, various countries bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">With christian faith and virtues, we shall find</div>
  <div class="i0">None answering the great ends of human kind,</div>
  <div class="i0">But this one rule of life; that shews us best</div>
  <div class="i0">How God may be appeased, and mortals blest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whether from length of time its worth we draw,</div>
  <div class="i0">The word is scarce more ancient than the law:</div>
  <div class="i0">Heaven's early care prescribed for every age;</div>
  <div class="i0">First, in the soul, and after, in the page.</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, whether more abstractedly we look,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or on the writers, or the written book,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whence, but from heaven, could men unskilled in arts,</div>
  <div class="i0">In several ages born, in several parts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Weave such agreeing truths? or how, or why</div>
  <div class="i0">Should all conspire to cheat us with a lie?</div>
  <div class="i0">Unasked their pains, ungrateful their advice,</div>
  <div class="i0">Starving their gain, and martyrdom their price.</div>
  <div class="i1">If on the book itself we cast our view,</div>
  <div class="i0">Concurrent heathens prove the story true:</div>
  <div class="i0">The doctrine, miracles; which must convince,</div>
  <div class="i0">For heaven in them appeals to human sense;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, though they prove not, they confirm the cause,</div>
  <div class="i0">When what is taught agrees with nature's laws.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then for the style, majestic and divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">It speaks no less than God in every line;</div>
  <div class="i0">Commanding words, whose force is still the same</div>
  <div class="i0">As the first fiat that produced our frame.</div>
  <div class="i0">All faiths, beside, or did by arms ascend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or sense indulged has made mankind their friend;</div>
  <div class="i0">This only doctrine does our lusts oppose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unfed by nature's soil, in which it grows;</div>
  <div class="i0">Cross to our interests, curbing sense, and sin;</div>
  <div class="i0">Oppressed without, and undermined within,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">It thrives through pain; it's own tormentors tires,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a stubborn patience still aspires.</div>
  <div class="i0">To what can reason such effects assign,</div>
  <div class="i0">Transcending nature, but to laws divine?</div>
  <div class="i0">Which in that sacred volume are contained,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sufficient, clear, and for that use ordained.</div>
  <div class="i1">But stay: the Deist here will urge anew,</div>
  <div class="i0">No supernatural worship can be true;</div>
  <div class="i0">Because a general law is that alone</div>
  <div class="i0">Which must to all, and every where, be known;</div>
  <div class="i0">A style so large as not this book can claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor aught that bears revealed religion's name.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis said, the sound of a Messiah's birth</div>
  <div class="i0">Is gone through all the habitable earth;</div>
  <div class="i0">But still that text must be confined alone</div>
  <div class="i0">To what was then inhabited, and known:</div>
  <div class="i0">And what provision could from thence accrue</div>
  <div class="i0">To Indian souls, and worlds discovered new?</div>
  <div class="i0">In other parts it helps, that, ages past,</div>
  <div class="i0">The scriptures there were known, and were embraced,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till sin spread once again the shades of night:</div>
  <div class="i0">What's that to these who never saw the light?</div>
  <div class="i1">Of all objections this indeed is chief,</div>
  <div class="i0">To startle reason, stagger frail belief:</div>
  <div class="i0">We grant, 'tis true, that heaven from human sense</div>
  <div class="i0">Has hid the secrets paths of providence;</div>
  <div class="i0">But boundless wisdom, boundless mercy, may</div>
  <div class="i0">Find even for those bewildered souls a way.</div>
  <div class="i0">If from his nature foes may pity claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">Much more may strangers, who ne'er heard his name;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, though no name be for salvation known,</div>
  <div class="i0">But that of his eternal sons<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> alone;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Who knows how far transcending goodness can</div>
  <div class="i0">Extend the merits of that son to man?</div>
  <div class="i0">Who knows what reasons may his mercy lead,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or ignorance invincible may plead?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not only charity bids hope the best,</div>
  <div class="i0">But more the great apostle has exprest:</div>
  <div class="i0">That, if the Gentiles, whom no law inspired,</div>
  <div class="i0">By nature did what was by law required;</div>
  <div class="i0">They, who the written rule had never known,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were to themselves both rule and law alone;</div>
  <div class="i0">To nature's plain indictment they shall plead,</div>
  <div class="i0">And by their conscience be condemned or freed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Most righteous doom! because a rule revealed</div>
  <div class="i0">Is none to those from whom it was concealed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then those, who followed reason's dictates right,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lived up, and lifted high their natural light,</div>
  <div class="i0">With Socrates may see their Maker's face,</div>
  <div class="i0">While thousand rubric-martyrs want a place.</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor does it baulk my charity, to find</div>
  <div class="i0">The Egyptian bishop of another mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, though his creed eternal truth contains,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis hard for man to doom to endless pains</div>
  <div class="i0">All, who believed not all his zeal required;</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless he first could prove he was inspired.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then let us either think he meant to say,</div>
  <div class="i0">This faith, where published, was the only way;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or else conclude, that, Arius to confute,</div>
  <div class="i0">The good old man, too eager in dispute,</div>
  <div class="i0">Flew high; and, as his christian fury rose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Damned all for heretics who durst oppose.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus far my charity this path has tried;</div>
  <div class="i0">A much unskilful, but well-meaning guide:</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet what they are, even these crude thoughts were bred</div>

  <div class="i0">If scripture, though derived from heavenly birth,</div>

  <div class="i0">Who never heard this question brought in play.</div>
  <div class="i0">The unlettered Christian, who believes in gross,</div>

  <div class="i0">The few by nature formed, with learning fraught,</div>
  <div class="i0">Born to instruct, as others to be taught,</div>
  <div class="i0">Must study well the sacred page; and see</div>
  <div class="i0">Which doctrine, this or that, does best agree</div>
  <div class="i0">With the whole tenor of the work divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plainliest points to heaven's revealed design;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which exposition flows from genuine sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">And which is forced by wit and eloquence.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not that tradition's parts are useless here,</div>
  <div class="i0">When general, old, disinterested, and clear;</div>
  <div class="i0">That ancient fathers thus expound the page,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gives truth the reverend majesty of age;</div>
  <div class="i0">Confirms its force by bideing every test;</div>
  <div class="i0">For best authorities, next rules, are best;</div>
  <div class="i0">And still the nearer to the spring we go,</div>
  <div class="i0">More limpid, more unsoiled, the waters flow.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, first, traditions were a proof alone;</div>
  <div class="i0">Could we be certain, such they were, so known;</div>
  <div class="i0">But since some flaws in long descent may be,</div>
  <div class="i0">They make not truth, but probability.</div>
  <div class="i0">Even Arius and Pelagius durst provoke</div>
  <div class="i0">To what the centuries preceding spoke:<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Such difference is there in an oft-told tale;</div>
  <div class="i0">But truth by its own sinews will prevail.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tradition written, therefore, more commends</div>
  <div class="i0">Authority, than what from voice descends;</div>
  <div class="i0">And this, as perfect as its kind can be,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rolls down to us the sacred history;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which from the universal church received,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is tried, and, after, for itself believed.</div>
  <div class="i1">The partial Papists would infer from hence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their church, in last resort, should judge the sense.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">But first they would assume, with wonderous art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Themselves to be the whole, who are but part</div>
  <div class="i0">Of that vast frame, the Church; yet grant they were</div>
  <div class="i0">The handers down, can they from thence infer</div>
  <div class="i0">A right to interpret? or, would they alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who brought the present, claim it for their own?</div>
  <div class="i0">The book's a common largess to mankind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not more for them than every man designed;</div>

<h2><a name="THRENODIA_AUGUSTALIS" id="THRENODIA_AUGUSTALIS"></a>THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS.</h2>


<p>The death of Charles II. was sudden and unexpected. After
he had apparently completely subdued the popular party, and
was preparing, as has been confidently alleged, a similar conquest
over the high-flying followers of the Duke of York, in the midst
of his present triumph and future projects, he was, on the morning
of the 2d February, 1684-5, seized with a sudden fit, which
resembled an apoplexy. He was bled by one King, a chemist, who
happened to be in waiting, and experienced a temporary relief.
From the 2d till the 6th, he continued in a languishing state, the
Duke of York being in constant attendance on his death-bed. On
the forenoon of the 6th, Charles died, to the general grief of his
subjects, by whom he was personally beloved, and who had reason
to fear, that his worst public measures would be followed out
with more rigour by his successor.</p>

<p>A numerous host of rhymers stepped forward with their condolences
upon this event.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Among these, we find few eminent names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
besides that of Dryden. Otway, indeed, has left a poem on the
subject, called "Windsor Castle;" and he began a pastoral, which,
fortunately for his reputation, he left unfinished.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> From the laureat
a deeper tone of lamentation was due. But whether the sense of discharging
a task, a sense so chilling always to poetical imagination,
had fettered Dryden's powers, or from whatever other reason, his
funeral pindaric has not been esteemed one of his happiest lyric
effusions. It is devoid of any appearance of deep feeling on the part
of the author himself. This is the more remarkable, as the manners
of Charles were eminently calculated to attract affection, and Dryden
had been admitted to a greater share of royal intercourse than
is usually necessary to excite the personal attachment of a subject
to a condescending monarch. But whether Dryden, as he is
sometimes believed to have owned, was unapt to feel or express
the more tender passions, or whether he saw the character of
Charles so closely, as to discern the selfishness of his hollow courtesy,
it is certain that the poet seems wonderfully little interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in the sorrowful theme. Even when he mentions his literary intercourse
with the deceased monarch, he does not suppress a murmur,
that he was niggard in rewarding the muses whom he loved;
that</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;little was their hire, and light their gain.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This absence of personal feeling on the part of the author,
spreads a coldness over the whole elegy; which we regret the less,
as the pensioned monarch ill deserved a deeper lamentation. It is
chiefly owing to this want of sympathy, connected with an over indulgence
in conceit, a fault which immediately flows from the
other, being an effort of ingenuity to supply the want of passion,
that the "Threnodia Augustalis" has been neglected. We have
to lament some overstrained metaphors and similes. The sun
went back <em>ten</em> degrees in the dial of Ahaz; a miraculous sign that
Hezekiah was to live; and this is compared to the <em>five</em> days during
which the disease of Charles gained ground, until it was obvious
that he was to die. The prayers of the people carrying heaven
by storm, and almost forcing heaven to revoke his decrees, is extravagant,
not to say profane. Yet, with all its faults of coldness
and conceit, this poem seems rather to have been under-rated.
It appears to great advantage, when compared with others on the
same subject. Otway, who affects a warmer display of passion, a
particular in which Dryden is said to have acknowledged his superiority,
has fallen into the opposite fault, of describing the death-bed
rather of a tender husband or lover, attended by his wife or
mistress, than that of a king waited on by his successor.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Dryden's
picture of the duke's grief is much more appropriate and
striking:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Horror in all his pomp was there,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mute and magnificent, without a tear.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The joy of the people upon the fallacious prospect of the king's
recovery, is also a striking picture:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Men met each other with erected look;</div>
  <div class="i0">The steps were higher that they took;</div>
  <div class="i0">Friends to congratulate their friends made haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">And long inveterate foes saluted as they past.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are many other fine passages in the "Threnodia;" though
the general effect is less impressive than might have been expected.
The description in the thirteenth stanza, for example, of the
effects on poetry and literature produced by the Restoration, and
that of the return of liberty,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Without whose charms even peace would be</div>
  <div class="i0">But a dull quiet slavery,</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>are both striking.&mdash;The character of Charles; his wit, parts, and
powers of conversation; his gentle manners, and firmness of disposition,
which, like a well-wrought blade, kept, even in yielding,
the native toughness of the steel,&mdash;are all themes of panegyric,
which, though perhaps exaggerated, are well-chosen, and exquisitely
brought out. It is indeed a peculiar attribute of Dryden's praise,
that it is always appropriate; while the gross adulation of his contemporaries
gave indiscriminately the same broad features to all their
subjects, and thereby very often converted their intended panegyric
into satire, not the less bitter because undesigned. Dryden,
for instance, in this whole poem has never once mentioned the
queen; sensible that the gaiety of Charles' life, and his frequent
amours, rendered her conjugal grief, which some of the elegiasts
chose to describe in terms approaching to blasphemy, an apocryphal,
as well as a delicate theme.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He knew, that praise, to do
honour to the giver and receiver, must either have a real foundation
in desert, or at least what, by the skilful management of the
poet, may be easily represented as such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Having discussed the melancholy part of his subject, the poet,
according to the approved custom in such cases, finds cause for
rejoicing in the succession of James, as he had mourned over the
death of his predecessor. From his firmness of character, and
supposed military talents, the poet prophesies a warlike and victorious
reign: a sad instance how seldom the poetic and prophetic
character, so often claimed, are united in the same individual! for
James, as is well known, far from conquering foreign kingdoms,
did not draw the sword even to defend his own. But very different
events were expected, and augured, by the shoal of versifiers,
who now rushed forwards to gratulate his accession.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The pindaric measure, in which the "Threnodia Augustalis" is
written, contains nothing pleasing to modern ears. The rhymes
are occasionally so far disjoined, that, like a fashionable married
couple, they have nothing of union but the name. The inequalities
of the verse are also violent, and remind us of ascending a broken
and unequal stair-case. But the age had been accustomed to
this rythm, which, however improperly, was considered as a genuine
imitation of the style of Pindar. It must also be owned, that
wherever, for a little way, Dryden uses a more regular measure,
he displays all his usual command of harmony. The thirteenth
stanza, for example, is as happily distinguished by melody of rhyme,
as we have already observed it is eminent in beauty of poetry.</p>

<p>The Latin title of this poem, like that of the <cite>Religio Laici</cite>,
savours somewhat of affectation; and has been taxed by Johnson
as not strictly classical, a more unpardonable fault.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>My learned friend, Dr Adam, has favoured me with the following
defence of Dryden's phrase: "With respect to the title which
that great poet gives to his elegy on the death of Charles, making
allowance for the taste of the times and the licence of poets in
framing names, I see no just foundation for Johnson's criticism on
the epithet <em>Augustalis</em>. <em>Threnodia</em> is a word purely Greek, used
by no Latin author; and <em>Augustalis</em> denotes, 'in honour of Augustus;'
thus, <em>ludi Augustales</em>, games instituted in honour of Augustis,
<em>Tac. An.</em> 1, 15 and 54; so <em>sacerdotes</em> vel <em>sodales Augustales</em>,
ib. and 2, 83. Hist. 2, 95. Now as <em>Augustus</em> was a name given
to the succeeding emperors, I see no reason, why <em>Augustalis</em> may
not be used to signify, 'in honour of any king.' Besides, the very
word <em>Augustus</em> denotes, 'venerable, august, royal:' and therefore
<em>Threnodia Augustalis</em> may properly be put for, 'An Elegy
in honour of an august Prince."</p>

<p>The full title declared the poem to be written "by John Dryden,
servant to his late majesty, and to the present king;" a style
which our author did not generally assume, but which the occasion
rendered peculiarly proper. The poem appears to have been
popular, as it went through two editions in the course of 1685.</p>

<p>Charles II. enjoyed excellent health, and was particularly careful
to preserve it by constant exercise. His danger, therefore, fell
like a thunder-bolt on his people, whose hearts were gained by his
easy manners and good humour, and who considered, that the
worst apprehensions they had ever entertained during his reign,
arose from the religion and disposition of his successor. The
mingled passions of affection and fear produced a wonderful sensation
on the nation. The people were so passionately concerned,
that North says, and appeals to all who recollected the time for
the truth of his averment, that it was rare to see a person walking
the street with dry eyes. <cite>Examen.</cite> p. 647.</p>

<p>If there is safety in the multitude of counsellors, Charles did not
find it in the multitude of physicians. Nine were in attendance,
all men of eminence; the presence of the least of whom, Le Sage
would have said, was fully adequate to account for the subsequent
catastrophe. They were Sir Thomas Millington, Sir Thomas
Witherby, Sir Charles Scarborough, Sir Edmund King, Doctors
Berwick, Charlton, Lower, Short, and Le Fevre. They signed a
declaration, that the king had died of an apoplexy.</p>

<p>An article was published in the Gazette, on the third day of the
king's illness, importing, "That his physicians now conceived him
to be in a state of safety, and that in a few days he would be freed
from his indisposition."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> North tells us, however, on the authority
of his brother, the Lord Keeper, that the only hope which
the physicians afforded to the council, was an assurance, (joyfully
communicated,) that the king was ill of a violent fever. The
council seeing little consolation in these tidings, one of the medical
gentlemen explained, by saying, that they now knew what they
had to do, which was to administer the cortex. This was done
while life lasted,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> although some of the physicians seem to have
deemed the prescription improper; in which case, Charles, after
escaping the poniards and pistols of the Jesuits, may be said to
have fallen a victim to their bark.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Dr Thomas Short, an eminent physician, who came into the
court practice when Dr Richard Lower, who formerly enjoyed
it, embraced the political principles of the Whig party. Short,
a Roman Catholic, and himself a Tory, was particularly acceptable
to the Tories. To this circumstance he probably owes the
compliment paid him by our author, and another from Lord Mulgrave
to the same purpose. Otway reckons, among his selected
friends,</p>

<p>Short, beyond what numbers can commend.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Duke has also inscribed to him his translation of the eleventh
Idyllium of Theocritus; beginning,</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i0">O Short! no herb nor salve was ever found,</div>
  <div class="i0">To ease a lover's heat, or heal his wound.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr Short, as one of the king's physicians, attended the death-bed
of Charles, and subscribed the attestation, that he died of an
apoplexy. Yet there has been ascribed to him an expression of
dubious import, which caused much disquisition at the time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
namely, that "the king had not fair play for his life." Burnet
says plainly, that "Short suspected poison, and talked more freely
of it than any Protestant durst venture to do at the time." He,
adds, that "Short himself was taken suddenly ill, upon taking a
large draught of wormwood wine, in the house of a Popish patient
near the Tower; and while on his death-bed, he told Lower, and
Millington, and other physicians, that he believed he himself was
poisoned, for having spoken too freely of the king's death."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Mulgrave
states the same report in these words, which, coming from a
professed Tory, are entitled to the greater credit: "I am obliged
to observe, that the most knowing and most deserving of all his
physicians did not only believe him poisoned, but thought himself
so too, not long after, for having declared his opinion a little
too boldly."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> North, in confutation of this report, has interpreted
Short's expression, as meaning nothing more than that the
king's malady was mistaken by his physicians, who, by their improper
prescriptions, deprived nature of fair play;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and he appeals
to all the eminent physicians who attended Dr Short in his
last illness, whether he did not fall a victim to his own bold method,
in using the cortex. Upon the whole, whatever opinion this
individual physician may have adopted through mistake, or affectation
of singularity, and whatever credit faction, or indeed popular
prejudice in general, may have given to such rumours at the time,
there appears no solid reason to believe that Charles died of poison.
Both Burnet and Mulgrave say, that they never heard a hint
that his brother was accessary to such a crime; and it is very unlikely
that any zealous Catholic should have had either opportunity,
or inclination, to hasten the reign of a prince of that religion,
by the unsolicited service of poisoning his brother. The other
physicians, several of whom, Lower, for example, were Whigs,
as well as Protestants, gave no countenance to this rumour,
which was circulated by a Catholic. And, as the symptoms of the
king's disorder are decidedly apoplectic, the report may be added
to those with which history abounds, and which are raised and
believed only because an extraordinary end is thought most fit
for the eminent and powerful.</p>

<p>Short, as we have incidentally noticed, survived his royal patient
but a few months. He was succeeded in his practice by Ratcliffe,
the famous Tory physician of Queen Anne's reign.</p>

<p>The historical accounts of the dying requests of Charles are
contradictory and obscure. It seems certain, that he earnestly recommended
his favourite mistress, the Duchess of Portsmouth,
to the protection of his successor. He had always, he said, loved
her, and he now loved her at the last. The Bishop of Bath presented
to him his natural son, the Duke of Richmond; whom he
blessed, and recommended, with his other children, to his successor's
protection; adding, "Do not let poor Nelly<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> starve."
He seems to have said nothing of the Duke of Monmouth, once so
much beloved, and whom, shortly before, he entertained thoughts
of recalling from banishment, and replacing in favour; perhaps he
thought, any recommendation to James of a rival so hated would
be ineffectual. Burnet says, he spoke not a word of the queen.
Echard, on the contrary, affirms, that, at the exhortation of the
Bishop of Bath, Charles sent for the queen, and asked and received
her pardon for the injuries he had done her bed.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In Fountainhall's
Manuscript, the queen is said to have sent a message, requesting
his pardon if she had ever offended him: "Alas, poor
lady!" replied the dying monarch, "she never offended me; I
have too often injured her."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This account seems more probable
than that of Echard; for so public a circumstance, as a personal
visit from the queen to her husband's death-bed, could hardly
have been disputed by contemporaries.</p>

<h2><span class="small50">THE</span><br />

HIND AND THE PANTHER.</h2>


<p>In the Life of Dryden, there is an attempt to trace the progress
and changes of those religious opinions, by which he was unfortunately
conducted into the errors of Popery. With all the
zeal of a now convert, he seems to have been impatient to invite
others to follow his example, by detailing, in poetry, the arguments
which had appeared to him unanswerable. "The Hind and the
Panther" is the offspring of that rage for proselytism, which is a peculiar
attribute of his new mother church. The author is anxious,
in the preface, to represent this poem as a task which he had voluntarily
undertaken, without receiving even the subject from any
one. His assertion seems worthy of full credit; for, although it
was the most earnest desire of James II. to employ every possible
mode for the conversion of his subjects, there is room to believe,
that, if the poem had been written under his direction, the tone
adopted by Dryden towards the sectaries would have been much
more mild. It is a well-known point of history, that, in order to
procure as many friends as possible to the repeal of the test act
and penal laws against the Catholics, James extended indulgence
to the puritans and sectarian non-conformists, the ancient
enemies of his person, his family, and monarchical establishments
in general. Dryden obviously was not in this court secret; the
purpose of which was to unite those congregations, whom he has
described under the parable of bloody bears, boars, wolves, foxes,
&amp;c. in a common interest with the Hind, against the exclusive privileges
of the Panther and her subjects. His work was written
with the precisely opposite intention of recommending an union
between the Catholics and the church of England; at least, of
persuading the latter to throw down the barriers, by which the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
were kept out of state employments. Such an union had at
one time been deemed practicable; and, in 1685, pamphlets had
been published, seriously exhorting the church of England to a
league with the Catholics, in order to root out the sectaries as
common enemies to both. The steady adherence of the church
of England to Protestant principles, rendered all hopes of such an
union abortive; and, while Dryden was composing his poem upon
this deserted plan, James was taking different steps to accomplish
the main purpose both of the poet and monarch.</p>

<p>The power of the crown to dispense, at pleasure, with the established
laws of the kingdom, had been often asserted, and sometimes exercised,
by former English monarchs. A king was entitled,
the favourers of prerogative argued, to pardon the breach of
a statute, when committed; why not, therefore, to suspend its effect
by a dispensation <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>, or by a general suspension of the
law? which was only doing in general, what he was confessedly
empowered to do in particular cases. But a doctrine so pernicious
to liberty was never allowed to take root in the constitution;
and the confounding the prerogative of extending mercy to individual
criminals, with that of annulling the laws under which they
had been condemned, was a fallacy easily detected and refuted.
Charles II. twice attempted to assert his supposed privilege of
suspending the penal laws, by granting a general toleration; and
he had, in both cases, been obliged to retract, by the remonstrances
of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But his successor, who conceived that his power
was situated on a more firm basis, and who was naturally obstinate
in his resolutions, was not swayed by this recollection. He
took every opportunity to exercise the power of dispensing with
the laws, requiring Catholics to take the test agreeable to act of
Parliament. He asserted his right to do so in his speech to the
Parliament, on 9th November, 1685; he despised the remonstrances
of both Houses, upon so flagrant and open a violation of
the law; and he endeavoured, by a packed bench, and a feigned
action at law, to extort a judicial ratification of his dispensing
power. At length, not contented with granting dispensations to
individuals, the king resolved at once to suspend the operation of
all penal statutes, which required conformity with the church of
England, as well as of the test act.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April, 1687, came forth the memorable Declaration
of Indulgence, in favour of all non-conformists of whatever
persuasion; by which they were not only protected in the full
exercise of their various forms of religion, but might, without conformity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
be admitted to all offices in the state. With what consequences
this act of absolute power was attended, the history of
the Revolution makes us fully acquainted; for it is surely unnecessary
to add, that the indulgence occasioned the petition and
trial of the bishops, the most important incident in that momentous
period.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the publishing of this declaration of indulgence,
our author's poem made its appearance; being licensed
on the 11th April, 1687, and published a few days after. If it was
undertaken without the knowledge of the court, it was calculated,
on its appearance, to secure the royal countenance and approbation.
Accordingly, as soon as it was published in England, a second
edition was thrown off at a printing office in Holyroodhouse,
Edinburgh, then maintained for the express purpose of disseminating
such treatises as were best calculated to serve the Catholic cause.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
If the Protestant dissenters ever cast their eyes upon profane poetry,
"The Hind and the Panther" must have appeared to them a
perilous commentary on the king's declaration; since it shows
clearly, that the Catholic interest alone was what the Catholic
king and poet had at heart, and that, however the former might
now find himself obliged to court their favour, to strengthen his
party against the established church, the deep remembrance of ancient
feuds and injuries was still cherished, and the desire of vengeance
on the fanatics neither sated nor subdued.</p>

<p>In composing this poem, it may be naturally presumed, that
Dryden exerted his full powers. He was to justify, in the eyes of
the world, a step which is always suspicious; and, by placing before
the public the arguments by which he had been induced to
change his religion, he was at once to exculpate himself, and induce
others to follow his example. He chose, for the mode of conveying
this instruction, that parabolical form of writing, which
took its rise perhaps in the East, or rather which, in a greater or
less degree, is common to all nations. An old author observes,
that there is "no species of four-footed beasts, of birds, of fish, of
insects, reptiles, or any other living things, whose nature is not
found in man. How exactly agreeable to the fox are some men's
tempers; whilst others are profest bears in human shape. Here
you shall meet a crocodile, who seeks, with feigned tears, to entrap
you to your ruin; there a serpent creeps, and winds himself into
your affections, till, on a sudden, when warmed with favours, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
will bite and sting you to death. Tygers, lions, leopards, panthers,
wolves, and all the monstrous generations of Africa, may be seen
masquerading in the forms of men; and 'tis not hard for an observing
mind to see their natural complexions through the borrowed
vizard."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Dryden conceived the idea, of extending to religious
communities the supposed resemblance between man and
the lower animals. Under the name of a "milk-white Hind, immortal
and unchanged," he described the unity, simplicity, and innocence
of the church, to which he had become a convert; and under
that of a Panther, fierce and inexorable towards those of a different
persuasion, he bodied forth the church of England, obstinate
in defending its pale from encroachment, by the penal statutes and
the test act.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> There wanted not critics to tell him, that he had
mistaken the character of either communion.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The inferior sects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
are described under the emblem of various animals, fierce and disgusting
in proportion to their more remote affinity to the church
of Rome. And in a dialogue between the two principal characters,
the leading arguments of the controversy between the churches,
at least what the poet chose to consider as such, are formally discussed.</p>

<p>But Dryden's plan is far from coming within the limits of a fable
or parable, strictly so called; for it is strongly objected, that
the poet has been unable to avoid confounding the real churches
themselves with the Hind and the Panther, under which they are
represented. "The hind," as Johnson observes, "at one time is
afraid to drink at the common brook, because she may be worried;
but, walking home with the panther, talks by the way of the Nicene
fathers, and at last declares herself to be the Catholic church."
And the same critic complains, "that the king is now Cæsar, and
now the lion, and that the name Pan is given to the Supreme Being."
"The Hind and Panther transversed, or the City and Country
Mouse," which was written in ridicule of this poem, turns
chiefly upon the incongruity of the emblems adopted by Dryden,
and the inconsistencies into which his plan had led him.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This ridicule,
and the criticism on which it is founded, seems, however,
to be carried a little too far. If a fable, or parable, is to be entirely
and exclusively limited to a detail which may suit the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
actions and properties of the animals, or things introduced in
it, we strike out from the class some which have always been held
the most beautiful examples of that style of fiction. It is surely as
easy to conceive a Hind and Panther discussing points of religion,
as that the trees of the forest should assemble together to chuse a
king, invite different trees to accept of that dignity, and, finally,
make choice of a bramble. Yet no one ever hesitates to pronounce
Jotham's Parable of the Trees one of the finest which ever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a><br /><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
written. Or what shall we say of one of the most common among
Æsop's apologues, which informs us in the outset, that the lion,
the ox, the sheep, and the ass, went a hunting together, on condition
of dividing equally whatever should be caught? Yet this and
many other fables, in which the animals introduced act altogether
contrary to their nature, are permitted to rank without censure in
the class which they assume. Nay, it may be questioned whether
the most proper fables are not those in which the animals are introduced
as acting upon the principles of mankind. For instance,
if an author be compared to a daw, it is no fable, but a simile;
but if a tale be told of a daw who dressed himself in borrowed
feathers, a thing naturally impossible, the simile becomes a proper
fable. Perhaps, therefore, it is sufficient for the fabulist, if he
can point out certain original and leading features of resemblance
betwixt his emblems, and that which they are intended to
represent, and he may be permitted to take considerable latitude
in their farther approximation. It may be farther urged in Dryden's
behalf, that the older poets whom he professed to imitate,
Spenser, for example, in "Mother Hubbart's Tale," which he has
actually quoted, and Chaucer, in that of the "Nun's Priest's tale"
have stepped beyond the simplicity of the ancient fable, and introduced
a species of mixed composition, between that and downright
satire. The names and characters of beasts are only assumed in
"Mother Hubbart's Tale," that the satirist might, under that
slight cloak, say with safety what he durst not otherwise have ventured
upon; and in the tale of Chaucer, the learned dialogue about
dreams is only put into the mouths of a cock and hen, to render
the ridicule of such disquisitions more poignant. Had Spenser
been asked, why he described the court of the lion as exactly similar
to that of a human prince, and introduced the fox as composing
madrigals for the courtiers? he would have bidden the
querist,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Yield his sense was all too blunt and base,</div>
  <div class="i0">That n'ote without a hound fine footing trace.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And if the question had been put to the bard of Woodstock, why,
he made his cock an astrologer, and his hen a physician, he would
have answered, that his satire might become more ludicrous, by
putting these grave speeches into the mouths of such animals.
Dryden seems to have proposed as his model this looser kind of parable;
giving his personages, indeed, the names of the Hind and
Panther, but reserving to himself the privilege of making the supposed
animals use the language and arguments of the communities
they were intended to represent. I must own, however, that this
licence appears less pardonable in the First Part, where he professes
to use the majestic turn of heroic poetry, than in those which are
dedicated to argument and satire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Dryden has, in this very poem, given us two examples of the
more pure and correct species of fable. These, which he terms
in the preface Episodes, are the tale of the Swallows seduced to
defer their emigration, and that of the Pigeons, who chose a Buzzard
for their king.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> It is remarkable, that, as the former is by
much the most complete story, so, although put in the mouth of
a representative of the heretical church, it proved eventually to
contain a truth sorrowful to our author, and those of the Roman
Catholic persuasion: For, while the Buzzard's elevation (Bishop
Burnet by name) was not attended with any peculiar evil consequences
to the church of England, the short gleam of Popish prosperity
was soon overcast, and the priests and their proselytes plunged
in reality into all the distress of the swallows in the Panther's
fable.</p>

<p>In conformity to our author's plan, announced in the preface,
the fable is divided into Three Parts. The First is dedicated to the
general description and character of the religious sects, particularly
the churches of Rome and of England. And here Dryden
has used the more elevated strain of heroic poetry. In the Second,
the general arguments of the controversy between the two
churches are agitated, for which purpose a less magnificent style
of language is adopted. In the Third and last Part, from discussing
the disputed points of theology, the Hind and Panther descend
to consider the particulars in which their temporal interests
were judged at this period to interfere with each other. And here
Dryden has lowered the tone of his verse to that of common conversation.
We must admit, with Johnson, that these distinctions
of style are not always accurately adhered to. The First Part has
familiar lines; as, for instance, the four with which it concludes:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Considering her a civil well-bred beast,</div>
  <div class="i0">And more a gentlewoman than the rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">After some common talk, what rumours ran,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lady of the spotted muff began.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some passages are not only mean in expression, but border on
profaneness; as,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The smith divine, as with a careless beat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Struck out the mute creation at a heat;</div>
  <div class="i0">But when at last arrived to human race,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Godhead took a deep considering space.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Third Part has passages in a higher tone of
poetry; particularly the whole character of James in the fable of the
Pigeons and the Buzzard: but it is enough to fulfil the author's
promise in the preface, that the parts do each in general preserve
a peculiar character and style, though occasionally sliding into
that of the others.</p>

<p>It is a main defect of the plan just detailed, that it necessarily
limited the interest of the poem to that crisis of politics when it
was published. A work, which the author announces as calculated
to attract the favour of friends, and to animate the malevolence
of enemies, is now read with cold indifference. He launched
forth into a tide of controversy, which, however furious at the
time, has long subsided, leaving his poem a disregarded wreck,
stranded upon the shores which the surges once occupied.</p>

<p>Setting aside this original defect, the First and Last Parts of the
poem, in particular, abound with passages of excellent poetry. In
the former, it is worthy attention, with what ease and command
of his language and subject Dryden passes from his sublime description
of the immortal Hind, to brand and stigmatise the sectaries
by whom she was hated and persecuted; a rare union of dignity
preserved in satire, and of satire engrafted upon heroic poetry.
The reader cannot, at the same time, fail to observe the felicity
with which the poet has assigned prototypes to the dissenting
churches, agreeing in character with that which he meant to
fix upon their several congregations. The Bear, unlicked to
forms, is the emblem of the Independents, who disclaimed them;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
the Wolf, which hunts in herds, to the classes and synods of
the Presbyterian church; the Hare, to the peaceful Quakers;
the wild Boar, to the fierce and savage Anabaptists, who ravaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Germany, the native country of that animal. With similar
felicity, the "bird, who warned St Peter of his fall," is,
from that circumstance, and his nocturnal vigils, afterwards assigned
as the representative of the Catholic clergy. Above all,
the attention is arrested by the pointed description of those dark
and sullen enthusiasts, who, scarcely agreeing among themselves
upon any peculiar points of doctrine, rested their claim to superior
sanctity upon abominating and contemning those usual forms of
reverence, by which men, in all countries since the beginning of
the world, have agreed to distinguish public worship from ordinary
or temporal employments. The whole of this First Part of the
poem abounds with excellent poetry, rising above the tone of ordinary
satire, and yet possessing all its poignancy. The difference,
to those against whom it is directed, is like that of being blasted
by a thunder-bolt, instead of being branded with a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>The First Part of "The Hind and Panther," although chiefly
dedicated to general characters, contains some reasoning on the
grand controversy, similar to that which occupies the Second.
The author displays, with the utmost art and energy of argumentative
poetry, the reasons by which he was himself guided in
adopting the Roman Catholic faith. He is led into this discussion,
by mentioning the heretical doctrine of the Unitarians; and insists,
that the Protestant churches, which have consented to postpone
human reason to faith, by acquiescing in the orthodox doctrine of
the Trinity, are not entitled to appeal to the authority which
they have waived, for arguments against the mystery of the real
presence in the eucharist. This was a favourite mode of reasoning
of the Catholics at the time, as may be seen from the
numerous treatises which they sent forth upon the controversy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
It is undoubtedly very fit to impose on the vulgar, but completely
overshoots the mark at which it aims. For, if our yielding
humble belief to one abstruse doctrine of divinity be sufficient to
debar the exercise of our reason respecting another, it is obvious,
that, by the same reason, the appeal to our understanding must
be altogether laid aside in matters of doubtful orthodoxy. The
Protestant divines, therefore, took a distinction; and, while they
admitted they were obliged to surrender their human judgment in
matters of divine revelation which were above their reason, they
asserted the power of appealing to its guidance in those things of a
finite nature which depend on the evidence of sense, and the consequent
privileges of rejecting any doctrine, which, being within
the sphere of human comprehension, is nevertheless repugnant to
the understanding: therefore, while they received the doctrine of
the Trinity as an infinite mystery, far above their reason, they
contended against that of transubstantiation as capable of being
tried by human faculties, and as contradicted by an appeal to
them. In a subsequent passage, the author taxes the church of
England with an attempt to reconcile contradictions, by admitting
the real presence in the eucharist, and yet denying actual transubstantiation.
Dryden boldly appeals to the positive words of scripture,
and sums his doctrine thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The literal sense is hard to flesh and blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">But nonsense never can be understood.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Granting, however, the obscurity or mystery of the one doctrine,
it is a hard choice to be obliged to adopt, in its room, that which
asserts an acknowledged impossibility.</p>

<p>In the Second Part, another point of the controversy is agitated;
the infallibility, namely, which is claimed by the Roman church.
The author appears here to have hampered himself in the toils of
his own argument in a former poem. He had asserted in the
"Religio Laici," that the Scriptures contained all things necessary
for salvation; while he yet admitted, that those, whose bent inclined
them to the study of polemical divinity, were to be guided by
the expositions of the fathers, and the earlier, especially the written,
traditions of the Church. There is, as has been noticed in
the remarks on "Religio Laici," a certain vacillation in our author's
arguments concerning tradition, while yet a Protestant, which
prepares us for his finally reposing his doubts in the bosom of that
church, which pretends to be the sole depositary of the earlier
doctrines of Christianity, and claims a right to ascertain all doubts
in point of faith, by the same mode, and with the same unerring
certainty, as the original church in the days of the apostles and
fathers. These doubts, with which Dryden seems to have been
deeply impressed while within the pale of the Church of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he now objects to her as inconsistencies, and accuses her of having
recourse to tradition, or discarding it, as suited the argument
which, for the time, she had in agitation. It is unnecessary here
to trace the various grounds on which reformed churches prove,
that the chain of apostolical tradition has been broken and shivered;
and that the church, claiming the proud title of Infallible, has
repeatedly sanctioned heresy and error. Neither is it necessary
to shew, how the Church of England stops short in her reception
of traditions, adopting only those of the primitive church.
Something on these points may be found in the notes. I may remark,
that Dryden is of the Gallican or <em>low</em> Church of Rome, if
I may so speak, and rests the infallibility which he claims for her
in the Pope and Council of the Church, and not in the Vicar of
Christ alone. In point of literary interest, this Second Part is
certainly beneath the other two. It furnishes, however, an excellent
specimen of poetical ratiocination upon a most unpromising
subject.</p>

<p>The Third Part refers entirely to the politics of the day; and
the poet has endeavoured, by a number of arguments, to remove
the deep jealousy and apprehensions which the king's religion, and
his zeal for proselytism, had awakened in the Church of England.
He does not even spare to allege a recent adoption of presbyterian
doctrines, as the reason for her unwonted resistance to the royal
will; and all the vigour of his satire is pointed against the latitudinarian
clergy, or, as they were finally called, the Low Church
Party, who now began to assert, what James at length found a
melancholy truth, that the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance
was not peremptorily binding, when the church herself
was endangered by the measures of the monarch. Stillingfleet,
the personal antagonist of our author, in the controversy concerning
the Duchess of York's posthumous declaration of faith, is personally
and ferociously attacked. The poem concludes with a fable
delivered by each of the disputants, of which the moral applies to
the project and hopes of her rival. We have already said, that
which is told by the Panther, as it is most spirited and pointed,
proved, to the great regret of the author, most strictly prophetic.
It is remarkable for containing a beautiful character of King
James, as the other exhibits a satirical portrait of the historian
Burnet, with whom the court party in general, and Dryden personally,
was then at enmity.</p>

<p>The verse in which these doctrines, polemical and political, are
delivered, is among the finest specimens of the English heroic
stanza. The introductory verses, in particular, are lofty and dignified
in the highest degree; as are those, in which the splendour
and majesty of the Church of Rome are set forth, in all the glowing
colours of rich imagery and magnificent language. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
same praise extends to the versification of the whole poem. It never
falls, never becomes rugged; rises with the dignified strain of
the poetry; sinks into quaint familiarity, where sarcasm and humour
are employed; and winds through all the mazes of theological
argument, without becoming either obscure or prosaic. The arguments
are in general advanced with an air of conviction and
candour, which, in those days, must have required the protestant
reader to be on his guard in the perusal, and which seems completely
to ascertain the sincerity of the author in his new religious
creed.</p>

<p>This controversial poem, containing a bold defiance to all who
opposed the king's measures or faith, had no sooner appeared,
than our author became a more general object of attack than he
had been even on the publication of "Absalom and Achitophel."
Indeed, his enemies were now far more numerous, including most
of his former friends, the <em>Tories</em> of the high church, excepting a
very few who remained attached to James, and saw, with anxiety,
his destruction precipitated by the measures he was adopting.</p>

<p>Montague and Prior were among the first to assail our author,
in the parody, of which we have just given a large specimen. It
must have been published before the 24th October 1687, for it is
referred to in "The Laureat," another libel against Dryden, inscribed
by Mr Luttrel with that date. This assault affected him
the more, as coming from persons with whom he had lived on habits
of civility. He is even said to have shed tears upon this occasion;
a report probably exaggerated, but which serves to shew,
that he was sensible he had exposed himself to the most unexpected
assailants, by the unpopularity of the cause which he had
espoused. Some further particulars respecting this controversy
are mentioned in Dryden's Life. Another poet, or parodier, published
"The Revolter, a tragi-comedy," in which he brings the
doctrines of the "Religio Laici," and of the "Hind and Panther,"
in battle array against each other, and rails at the author
of both with the most unbounded scurrility.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only new enemies arose against him, but the hostility of
former and deceased foes seemed to experience a sort of resurrection.
Four Letters, by Matthew Clifford of the Charter-House,
containing notes upon Dryden's poems and plays, were now either
published for the first time, or raked up from the obscurity of
a dead-born edition, to fill up the cry of criticism against him
on all sides. They are coarse and virulent to the last degree, and
so far served the purpose of the publishers; but, as they had no
reference to "The Hind and Panther," that defect was removed
by a supplementary Letter from the facetious Tom Brown, an author,
whose sole wish was to attain the reputation of a successful
buffoon, and who, like the jesters of old, having once made himself
thoroughly absurd and ridiculous, gained a sort of privilege
to make others feel his grotesque raillery.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Besides the reflections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
contained in this letter, Brown also published "The New
Converts exposed, or Reasons for Mr Bayes changing his Religion,"
in two parts; the first of which appeared in 1688, and
the second in 1690. From a passage in the preface to the first
part, which may serve as a sample of Tom's buffoonery, we learn,
Dryden publicly complained, that, although he had put his name
to "The Hind and Panther," those who criticized or replied to
that poem had not imitated his example.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of these witty varlets published, in 1688, "Religio
Laici, or a Layman's Faith, touching the Supreme Head and Infallible
Guide of the Church, in two letters, &amp;c. by J. R. a convert
of Mr Bayes," licensed June the 1st, 1688. From this pamphlet
we have given some extracts in the introductory remarks to
"Religio Laici," pp. 9, 10.</p>

<p>There were, besides, many libels of the most personal kind
poured forth against Dryden by the poets who supplied the usual
demand of the hawkers. One of the most virulent contains a singular
exhibition of rage and impotence. It professes to contain a
review of our poet's life and literary labours, and calls itself "The
Laureat." This, as containing some curious particulars, is given
below.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The cry against our author being thus general, we may reasonably
suppose, that he would have taken some opportunity to exercise
his powers of retort upon those who were most active or
most considerable among the aggressors, and that Montague and
Prior stood a fair chance of being coupled up with Doeg and Og,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
his former antagonists. But, if Dryden entertained any intention
of retaliation, the Revolution, which crushed his rising prospects,
took away both the opportunity and inclination. From that period,
the fame of "The Hind and Panther" gradually diminished,
as the controversy between Protestant and Papist gave way to
that between Whig and Tory. Within a few years after the first
publication of the poem, Swift ranks it among the compositions
of Grubstreet; ironically terms it, "the master-piece of a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
author, now living, intended as a complete abstract of sixteen
thousand schoolmen, from Scotus to Bellarmine;" and immediately
subjoins, "Tommy Potts, supposed by the same hand,
by way of Supplement to the former."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> With such acrimony do
men of genius treat the productions of each other; and so certain
it is, that, to enjoy permanent reputation, an author must chuse
a theme of permanent interest.</p>

conscience is the common word which is given by
both, yet if a writer fall among enemies, and cannot
give the marks of <em>their</em> conscience, he is knocked
down before the reasons of his own are heard.
A preface, therefore, which is but a bespeaking of
favour, is altogether useless. What I desire the
reader should know concerning me, he will find in
the body of the poem, if he have but the patience
to peruse it. Only this advertisement let him take
before-hand, which relates to the merits of the cause.</p>

<p>No general characters of parties (call them either
sects or churches) can be so fully and exactly drawn,
as to comprehend all the several members of them;
at least all such as are received under that denomination.
For example; there are some of the church
by law established, who envy not liberty of conscience
to dissenters; as being well satisfied that,
according to their own principles, they ought not
to persecute them. Yet these, by reason of their
fewness, I could not distinguish from the numbers
of the rest, with whom they are embodied in one
common name. On the other side, there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of our sects, and more indeed than I could reasonably
have hoped, who have withdrawn themselves
from the communion of the Panther, and embraced
this gracious indulgence of his majesty in point of
toleration. But neither to the one nor the other of
these is this satire any way intended: it is aimed
only at the refractory and disobedient on either side.
For those, who are come over to the royal party,
are consequently supposed to be out of gun-shot.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Our physicians have observed, that, in process of
time, some diseases have abated of their virulence,
and have in a manner worn out their malignity, so
as to be no longer mortal; and why may not I suppose
the same concerning some of those, who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
formerly been enemies to kingly government, as
well as Catholic religion? I hope they have now
another notion of both, as having found, by comfortable
experience, that the doctrine of persecution
is far from being an article of our faith.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>It is not for any private man to censure the proceedings
of a foreign prince:<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but, without suspicion
of flattery, I may praise our own, who has taken
contrary measures, and those more suitable to the
spirit of Christianity. Some of the dissenters, in
their addresses to his majesty, have said, "That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
has restored God to his empire over conscience."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
I confess, I dare not stretch the figure to so great
a boldness: but I may safely say, that conscience
is the royalty and prerogative of every private man.
He is absolute in his own breast, and accountable
to no earthly power for that which passes only betwixt
God and him. Those who are driven into
the fold are, generally speaking, rather made hypocrites
than converts.</p>

<p>This indulgence being granted to all the sects,
it ought in reason to be expected, that they should
both receive it, and receive it thankfully. For, at
this time of day, to refuse the benefit, and adhere
to those whom they have esteemed their persecutors,
what is it else but publicly to own, that they
suffered not before for conscience-sake, but only out
of pride and obstinacy, to separate from a church
for those impositions, which they now judge may
be lawfully obeyed? After they have so long contended
for their classical ordination (not to speak of
rites and ceremonies) will they at length submit to
an episcopal? If they can go so far, out of complaisance
to their old enemies, methinks a little reason
should persuade them to take another step, and
see whither that will lead them.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the receiving this toleration thankfully, I shall
say no more, than that they ought, and I doubt not
they will consider from what hand they received it.
It is not from a Cyrus, a heathen prince, and a foreigner,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
but from a christian king, their native sovereign;
who expects a return in specie from them,
that the kindness, which he has graciously shewn
them, may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion.</p>

<p>As for the poem in general, I will only thus far
satisfy the reader, that it was neither imposed on
me, nor so much as the subject given me by any
man. It was written during the last winter, and
the beginning of this spring; though with long
interruptions of ill health and other hindrances.
About a fortnight before I had finished it, his majesty's
Declaration for liberty of conscience came
abroad; which, if I had so soon expected, I might
have spared myself the labour of writing many
things which are contained in the third part of it.
But I was always in some hope, that the church of
England might have been persuaded to have taken
off the penal laws and the test, which was one design
of the poem, when I proposed to myself the
writing of it.</p>

<p>It is evident that some part of it was only occasional,
and not first intended: I mean that defence
of myself, to which every honest man is bound,
when he is injuriously attacked in print; and I refer
myself to the judgment of those, who have read
the answer to the Defence of the late king's Papers,
and that of the duchess, (in which last I was concerned)
how charitably I have been represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
there.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I am now informed both of the author and
supervisors of this pamphlet, and will reply, when
I think he can affront me: for I am of Socrates's
opinion, that all creatures cannot. In the mean
time let him consider whether he deserved not a more
severe reprehension than I gave him formerly, for
using so little respect to the memory of those, whom
he pretended to answer; and, at his leisure, look
out for some original treatise of humility, written
by any Protestant in English; (I believe I may say
in any other tongue:) for the magnified piece of
Duncombe on that subject, which either he must
mean, or none, and with which another of his fellows
has upbraided me, was translated from the
Spanish of Rodriguez; though with the omission
of the seventeenth, the twenty-fourth, the twenty-fifth,
and the last chapter, which will be found in
comparing of the books.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>He would have insinuated to the world, that her
late Highness died not a Roman Catholic. He declares
himself to be now satisfied to the contrary,
in which he has given up the cause: for matter of
fact was the principal debate betwixt us. In the
mean time, he would dispute the motives of her
change; how preposterously, let all men judge,
when he seemed to deny the subject of the controversy,
the change itself.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And because I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
not take up this ridiculous challenge, he tells the
world I cannot argue: but he may as well infer,
that a Catholic cannot fast, because he will not take
up the cudgels against Mrs James,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> to confute the
Protestant religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>I have but one word more to say concerning the
poem as such, and abstracting from the matters,
either religious or civil, which are handled in it.
The First Part, consisting most in general characters
and narration, I have endeavoured to raise, and give
it the majestic turn of heroic poesy. The Second,
being matter of dispute, and chiefly concerning
church authority, I was obliged to make as plain
and perspicuous as possibly I could; yet not wholly
neglecting the numbers, though I had not frequent
occasions for the magnificence of verse. The
Third, which has more of the nature of domestic
conversation, is, or ought to be, more free and familiar
than the two former.</p>

<p>There are in it two episodes, or fables, which are
interwoven with the main design; so that they are
properly parts of it, though they are also distinct
stories of themselves. In both of these I have made
use of the common-places of satire, whether true or
false, which are urged by the members of the one
church against the other: at which I hope no reader
of either party will be scandalized, because they
are not of my invention, but as old, to my knowledge,
as the times of Boccace and Chaucer on the
one side, and as those of the Reformation on the
other.</p>

<p>The critics fastened on this line with great exultation, concluding,
that doomed and fated mean precisely the same thing.
"Faith, Mr Bayes," says one of these gentlemen, "if you were
<em>doomed</em> to be hanged, whatever you were <em>fated</em> to 'twould give
you but small comfort."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This criticism is quite erroneous;
doom, in its general acceptation, meaning merely a sentence of any
kind, the pronouncing which by no means necessarily implies its execution.
In the criminal courts of Scotland, the sentence is always
concluded with this formula, "and this I pronounce for doom." Till
of late years, a special officer recited the sentence after the judge,
and was thence called the <em>doomster</em>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> an office now performed by
the clerk of court. The criticism is founded on the word <em>doom</em>
having been often, and even generally, used as synonimous to the
sentence of heaven, and therefore inevitable. But in the text, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
is obvious that the doom, or sentence, of an earthly tribunal is
placed in opposition to the decree of Providence.</p>

<p>The sect of Independents arose to great eminence in the civil
wars, when the enthusiastic spirits were deemed entitled to preferment
upon earth, in proportion to the extravagance of their religious
zeal. Hume has admirably described their leading tenets,
or rather the scorn with which they discarded the principles
of other religious sects; for their peculiarities consisted much
more in their neglect and contempt of all forms, than in any rules
or dogmata of their own.</p>

<p>"The Independents rejected all ecclesiastical establishments,
and would admit of no spiritual courts, no government among
pastors, no interposition of the magistrate in religious concerns,
no fixed encouragement annexed to any system of doctrines or
opinions. According to their principles, each congregation, united
voluntarily and by spiritual ties, composed, within itself, a separate
church, and exercised a jurisdiction, but one destitute of
temporal sanctions, over its own pastor and its own members. The
election alone of the congregation was sufficient to bestow the
sacerdotal character; and, as all essential distinction was denied
between the laity and the clergy, no ceremony, no institution, no
vocation, no imposition of hands, was, as in all other churches,
supposed requisite to convey a right to holy orders. The enthusiasm
of the Presbyterians led them to reject the authority of
prelates, to throw off the restraint of liturgies, to retrench ceremonies,
to limit the riches and authority of the priestly office.
The fanaticism of the Independents, exalted to a higher pitch, abolished
ecclesiastical government, disdained creeds and systems,
neglected every ceremony, and confounded all ranks and orders.
The soldier, the merchant, the mechanic, indulging the fervours
of zeal, and guided by the illapses of the spirit, resigned himself to
an inward and superior direction, and was consecrated, in a manner,
by an immediate intercourse and communication with heaven."</p>

<p>Butler thus describes the Independents:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
 <div class="i0">The Independents, whose first station</div>
 <div class="i0">Was in the rear of reformation:</div>
 <div class="i0">A mongrel kind of church dragoons,</div>
 <div class="i0">That served for horse and foot at once,</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is well known, that these sectaries obtained the final ascendancy
in the civil wars. Cromwell, their chief, was highly gifted as
a preacher as well as a warrior; witness his "learned, devout, and
conscientious exercise, held at Sir Peter Temple's, in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, upon Romans xiii. 1."</p>

 <div class="i0"><em>Professed neutrality, but would not swear.</em>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Mr Hume's account of the rise of this sect (the quakers) is
uncommonly lively, I take the liberty to insert it at length; though,
perhaps, the passage does not call for so prolonged a quotation.
After describing the ascetic solitude of George Fox, their founder,
he proceeds:</p>

<p>"When he had been sufficiently consecrated, in his own imagination,
he felt that the fumes of self-applause soon dissipate, if
not continually supplied by the admiration of others; and he began
to seek proselytes. Proselytes were easily gained, at a time
when all men's affections were turned towards religion, and when
extravagant modes of it were sure to be most popular. All the
forms of ceremony, invented by pride and ostentation, Fox and
his disciples, from a superior pride and ostentation, carefully rejected:
Even the ordinary rites of civility were shunned, as the
nourishment of carnal vanity and self-conceit. They would bestow
no titles of distinction: The name of friend was the only salutation
with which they indiscriminately accosted every one. To
no person would they make a bow, or move their hat, or give any
signs of reverence. Instead of that affected adulation introduced
into modern tongues, of speaking to individuals as if they were a
multitude, they returned to the simplicity of ancient languages;
and <em>thou</em> and <em>thee</em> were the only expressions which, on any consideration,
they would be brought to employ.</p>

<p>"Dress too, a material circumstance, distinguished the members
of this sect. Every superfluity and ornament was carefully
retrenched: No plaits to their coat, no buttons to their sleeves:
No lace, no ruffles, no embroidery. Even a button to the hat,
though sometimes useful, yet not being always so, was universally
rejected by them with horror and detestation.</p>

<p>"The violent enthusiasm of this sect, like all high passions,
being too strong for the weak nerves to sustain, threw the preachers
into convulsions, and shakings, and distortions in their limbs;
and they thence received the appellation of Quakers. Amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the great toleration which was then granted to all sects, and even
encouragement given to all innovations, this sect alone suffered
persecution. From the fervour of their zeal, the quakers broke
into churches, disturbed public worship, and harrassed the minister
and audience with railing and reproaches. When carried before
a magistrate, they refused him all reverence, and treated him
with the same familiarity as if he had been their equal. Sometimes
they were thrown into mad-houses, sometimes into prisons:
Sometimes whipped, sometimes pilloried. The patience and fortitude
with which they suffered, begat compassion, admiration,
esteem. A supernatural spirit was believed to support them under
those sufferings, which the ordinary state of humanity, freed
from the illusions of passion, is unable to sustain.</p>

<p>"The quakers creep'd into the army: But, as they preached
universal peace, they seduced the military zealots from their profession,
and would soon, had they been suffered, have put an end,
without any defeat or calamity, to the dominion of the saints.
These attempts became a fresh ground for persecution, and a new
reason for their progress among the people.</p>

<p>"Morals, with this sect, were carried, or affected to be carried,
to the same degree of extravagance as religion. Give a quaker
a blow on one cheek, he held up the other: Ask his cloke, he
gave you his coat also. The greatest interest could not engage
him in any court of judicature, to swear even to the truth. He
never asked more for his wares than the precise sum which he
was determined to accept. This last maxim is laudable, and continues
still to be religiously observed by that sect.</p>

<p>"No fanatics ever carried farther the hatred to ceremonies,
forms, orders, rites, and positive institutions. Even baptism and
the Lord's supper, by all other sects believed to be interwoven
with the very vitals of Christianity, were disdainfully rejected by
them. The very Sabbath they profaned. The holiness of churches
they derided; and they would give to these sacred edifices no
other appellation than that of shops, or steeple-houses. No
priests were admitted in their sects: Every one had received,
from immediate illumination, a character much superior to the
sacerdotal. When they met for divine worship, each rose up in
his place, and delivered the extemporary inspirations of the Holy
Ghost: Women were also admitted to teach the brethren, and
were considered as proper vehicles to convey the dictates of the
spirit. Sometimes a great many preachers were moved to speak
at once: Sometimes a total silence prevailed in their congregation.</p>

<p>"Some quakers attempted to fast forty days in imitation of
Christ; and one of them bravely perished in the experiment. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
female quaker came naked into the church where the protector
sat; being moved by the spirit, as she said, to appear as a sign to
the people. A number of them fancied, that the renovation of all
things had commenced, and that clothes were to be rejected, together
with other superfluities.&mdash;The sufferings which followed
the practice of this doctrine, were a species of persecution not
well calculated for promoting it."</p>

<p>The quakers were particularly favoured by James II., owing to
the interest which Penn, the settler of Pennsylvania, had with that
monarch. That person took a lead in the controversy concerning
the Indulgence, by publishing a pamphlet, entitled, "Good Advice
to the Church of England."</p>

<p>The sect of free-thinkers, who professed a disbelief in revealed religion,
was to be found even among the fanatical ranks of the Long
Parliament. Harvey, Martin, Sidney, and others, were considered
as the chiefs of this little party. After the restoration of Charles
II., these loose principles became prevalent among his gay courtiers,
and were supposed to have been privately adopted by the
king himself, who was educated by the sceptic Hobbes. As the
free-thinkers taught a total disbelief of revelation, and indifference
for religious forms, they left their disciples at liberty occasionally
to conform to whatever creed, or form of worship, might appear
most conducive to their temporal interests. Sunderland was supposed
to belong to this sect, for he made his change to Popery,
without even the form of previous instruction or conference; evincing
to the whole world, that, being totally indifferent about all
religions, he was ready to embrace any that would best serve his
immediate views. This statesman's character, as a latitudinarian
in religion, is mentioned with great bitterness by the Princess
Anne, afterwards queen, in her private correspondence with her
sister, the Princess of Orange.&mdash;See <cite>Dalrymple's Memoirs</cite>, Vol. II.
p. 169. 8vo. edit. Dryden probably intended a sarcasm at Sunderland,
or some such time-serving courtier, for his occasional conformity
with the royal faith, of which there were several instances
at the time. These persons, as they attended James to mass, were
compared to Naaman, who, on adopting the Jewish religion, craved
an indulgence for waiting upon his master to the house of the idol
Rimmon. It is hinted in "The Hind and Panther Transversed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that Dryden's satire is personal; for he is made to quote the lines,
and to add, by way of commentary, "That galls somewhere!
Egad, I cannot leave it off, though I were cudgelled every day for
it."</p>

<p>The church party, among other pamphlets intended to ridicule
the Declaration of Indulgence, and as a parody of the addresses of
the dissenters on that occasion, published, "To the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, the Humble Address of the Atheists, or the
Sect of Epicureans." After congratulating the king on having
freed his subjects from the solemn superstition of oaths, they proceed:
"Your majesty was pleased to wish, that all your subjects
were of your own religion; and perhaps every division wishes you
were of theirs; but, for our parts, we freely declare, that if ever
we should be obliged to profess any religion, we would prefer the
Church of Rome, which does not much trouble the world with
the affairs of invisible beings, and is very civil and indulgent to the
failings of human nature. That church can ease us from the
grave fatigues of religion, and, for our monies, allow us proxies,
both for piety and penances: We can easily swallow and digest a
wafer deity, and will never cavil at the mass in an unknown
tongue, when the sacrifice itself is so unintelligible. We shall
never scruple the adoration of an image, when the chiefest religion
is but imagination; and we are willing to allow the Pope an absolute
power to dispense with all penal laws, in this world and in
another. But before we return to Rome, the greatest origin of
atheism, we wish the Pope, and all his vassal princes, would free
the world from the fear of hell and devils, the inquisition and
dragoons, and that he would take off the chimney-money of purgatory,
and custom and excise of pardons and indulgencies, which
are so much inconsistent with the flourishing trade and grandeur
of the nation. As for the engagements of lives and fortunes, the
common compliment of addressers, we confess we have a more
peculiar tenderness for those most sacred concernments; but yet
we will hazard them in defence of your majesty, with as much
constancy and resolution as your majesty will defend your indulgence;
that is, so far as the adventure will serve our designs and
interest.</p>

<p>The sect of Anabaptists, whose principal tenet is the disallowing
of infant baptism, arose in Germany and the Low Countries about
the year 1521. This new light, for such it was esteemed, happened
unfortunately to appear to some of the most ignorant and
ferocious of the Low German burghers and boors. Thomas Muncer,
by birth a Saxon, was the principal apostle of this sect.
He preached both against the Papists and Luther, recommending
the eschewing of open crimes, the chastening of the body by severities
of abstinence, and the wearing a long beard. With these
tenets, he combined that of an immediate intercourse with God,
by demanding of him signs and tokens, which would be infallibly
granted, and that of an universal community of goods. These two
last doctrines, concerning spiritual and temporal matters, were admirably
calculated to turn the heads of his followers. Being banished
from Saxony, he seized upon the monastery of Muhlhans, from
which he expelled the monks; and afterwards made a convert of
one Pfeifer, a daring enthusiast, who, because in a dream he had
put to flight an innumerable number of mice, made no doubt he
was destined to vanquish all principalities and powers. Muncer
easily prevailed on this visionary conqueror to head the miners of
the country of Mansfeldt, in some ferocious inroads into Saxony.
The Dukes of Saxony and Brunswick, the Landgrave of Hesse,
and other German princes, marched against these madmen, whom
Muncer stimulated to resistance, by assuring them, that a rainbow,
which happened then to be visible, was an indubitable sign
of victory. The poor deluded wretches accordingly suffered
themselves to be quietly cut to pieces, with their eyes fixed on
the heavenly sign, in expectation of divine assistance. Muncer
was made prisoner, and recanted before his death, only blaming
the princes for their cruelty and oppression to their vassals, which
drove them to desperation;&mdash;so, if he lived a false prophet, he
died a true preacher. His death, and that of Pfeifer, with the
slaughter made among their followers, did not extirpate the heresy;
and the most dreadful consequences attended, for some time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
progress of these enthusiastic opinions. A tailor, called Bockholdt,
better known by the name of John of Leyden, with his associates,
Rotman, Matthews, and Cnipperdoling, in 1535, actually
possessed themselves of the city of Munster, expelled the bishop,
and commenced the reign of the saints. Their leader, under the
strange and horrible delusion that he was inspired by the Holy
Ghost, played the most outrageous pranks of lust and cruelty that
ever madness dictated: Yet, amidst their frenzy, the Anabaptists
had valour and conduct sufficient to defend the city for a length of
time against the bishop and his allies; and while the unfortunate
inhabitants were in the utmost misery, the enthusiasts themselves
revelled in the indulgence of every licentious appetite. At length
the city was taken, and a cruel, though deserved punishment, inflicted
upon those who had been the leaders in this holy warfare.
John of Leyden himself was torn to pieces with hot pincers. After
this memorable event, those who retained the principles of this sect
were not desirous of being distinguished by a name which the excesses
of these fanatics had rendered an abomination to all the
Christian world. They were generally confounded with the Independents,
with whom they hold many principles in common,
particularly, I believe, the disavowal of any clerical order. Yet
if, for a time, they "lurked in sects unseen," as Dryden assures
us, the sunshine of general toleration soon brought them out under
their own proper appellation. We have, among the addresses
of various classes of dissenters upon the Declaration of Indulgence,
that of the Anabaptists in and about the city of London, who, indeed,
were the very first in expressing their thanks and loyalty.
The Anabaptists of Leicestershire, the Independents and Baptists of
Gloucester, the Anabaptists of Cheshire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. all came forward with loyal acclamations on
the same occasion.</p>

<p>Arius, the propagator of a great heresy in the Christian church,
denied that God the Son was equal to God the Father, or that he
was co-existent with him. See page 16. This doctrine he maintained
in the council at Nice against Athanasius, the champion of orthodoxy;
and although his doctrines were condemned by the general
council, and he himself banished, yet his party was so powerful
as to accomplish his restoration, and the banishment of Athanasius,
who fled into the Thebais, or deserts of Upper Egypt. The schism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
thus occasioned, continued long to divide the Christian church.
Lelius Socinus, a nobleman of Sienna, revived and enlarged the
doctrine of Arius, about the latter end of the sixteenth century.
His nephew Faustus collected, arranged, and published his opinions,
which have since had many followers. The Socinians
teach the worship of one God, without distinction of persons;
affirming, that the Holy Ghost is but another expression for the
power of God; and that Jesus Christ is only the Son of God
by adoption. As they deny our Saviour's divinity, they disavow,
of course, the doctrine of redemption, and consider him only as a
prophet, gifted with a more than usual share of inspiration, and
sealing his mission by his blood. This heresy has, at different
times, and under various disguises and modifications, insinuated itself
into the Christian church, forming, as it were, a resting place,
though but a tottering one, between natural and revealed religion.
Here, I fear, the author's lines apply:</p>

<p>"Then the same day, at evening, being the first day of the
week, when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you."</p>

<p>Again, "And after eight days, again his disciples were within,
and Thomas with them; then came Jesus, the doors being shut,
and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."&mdash;<cite>The Gospel
of St John</cite>, chap. xx. verses 19. 26.</p>

<p>From these passages of Scripture, Dryden endeavours to confute
the objection to transubstantiation, founded on the host being
consecrated in various places at the same time, in each of
which, however, the body of Christ becomes present, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to the Papist doctrine. This being predicated of the real body
of our Saviour, the Protestants allege is impossible, as matter can
only be in one place at the same time. Dryden, in answer, assumes,
that Christ entered into the meeting of the disciples, by
actually passing through the closed doors of the apartment; and
as, at the moment of such passage, two bodies must have been in
the same place at the same instant, the body of Jesus namely, and
the substance through which he passed, the poet founds on it as
an instance of a transgression of a natural law, proved from Scripture,
as violent as that of one body being in several different places
at once. But the text does not prove the major part of Dryden's
proposition; it is not stated positively by the evangelist, that our
Saviour passed <em>through</em> the doors which were shut, but merely
that he <em>came and stood among his disciples</em> without the doors being
opened; which miraculous appearance might take place many
ways besides that on which Dryden has fixed for the foundation
of his argument.</p>

<p>The personal appearance of the Presbyterian clergy was suited
by an affectation of extreme plainness and rigour of appearance.
A Geneva cloak and band, with the hair close cropped, and covered
with a sort of black scull-cap, was the discriminating attire
of their teachers. This last article of dress occasioned an unseemly
projection of their ears, and procured those who affected
it the nick-name of prick-eared fanatics, and the still better known
appellation of Round-heads. Our author proceeds, with great
bitterness, to investigate the origin of Calvinism. His account of
the rise and destruction of a sect of heretics in Cambria may be
understood to refer to the ancient British church, which disowned
the supremacy of the see of Rome, refused to adopt her ritual,
and opposed St Augustin's claims to be metropolitan of Britain, in
virtue of Pope Gregory's appointment. They held two conferences
with Augustin; at one of which he pretended to work a
miracle by the cure of a blind man; at the second, seven British
bishops, and a numerous deputation from the monastery of
Bangor, disputed with Augustin, who denounced vengeance against
them by the sword of the Saxons, in case they refused to submit
to the see of Rome. His prophecy, which had as little effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
upon the Welch clergy as his miracle, was shortly afterwards accomplished:
For Ethelfred, the Saxon king of Northumberland,
having defeated the British under the walls of Chester, cut to
pieces no fewer than twelve hundred of the monks of Bangor, who
had come to assist their countrymen with their prayers. Our
author alludes to this extermination of the British recusant clergy,
by comparing it to the census, or tribute of wolves-heads, imposed
on the Cambrian kings. It has been surmised by some authors,
that Augustin himself instigated this massacre, and thereby
contributed to the accomplishment of his own prophecy. Other
authorities say, that he died in 604, and that the monks of Bangor
were slain in 613. Perhaps, however, our author did not mean
to carry the rise of Presbytery so far back, but only referred to
the doctrines of Wiccliff, who, in the reign of Edward III., and
his successor Richard II., taught publicly at Oxford several doctrines
inconsistent with the supremacy of the Pope, and otherwise
repugnant to the doctrines of the Roman church. He was protected
during his lifetime by John of Gaunt; but, forty years after
his death, his bones were dug up and burned for heresy. His
followers were called Lollards, and were persecuted with great severity
in the reign of Henry V., Lord Cobham and many others
being burned to death. Thinking, perhaps, either of these too
honourable and ancient a descent for the English Presbyterians,
our author next refers to Heylin, who brings them from Geneva,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
where the reformed doctrine was taught by the well known Zuinglius,
and the still more famous Calvin. The former began to
preach the Reformation at Zurich about 1518, and disputed publicly
with one Sampson, a friar, whom the Pope had sent thither
to distribute indulgences. Zuinglius was persecuted by the bishop
of Constance; but, being protected by the magistrates of Zurich,
he set him at defiance, and in 1523 held an open disputation before
the senate, with such success, that they commanded the traditions
of the church to be thrown aside, and the gospel to be taught
through all their canton. Zuinglius, in some respects, merited the
epithet of <em>fiery</em>, which Dryden has given him; he was an ardent
lover of liberty, and dissuaded his countrymen from a league with
the French, by which it must have been endangered; he vindicated,
from Scripture, the doctrine of resisting oppressors and asserting
liberty, of which he said God was the author, and would be
the defender;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and, finally, he was killed in battle between the inhabitants
of Zurich and those of the five small cantons. The
conquerors, being Catholics, treated his dead body with the most
shameless indignity.</p>

<p>The history of Calvin is too well known to need recital in this
place. He was expelled from France, his native country, on account
of his having adopted the doctrines of the reformers, and,
taking refuge in Geneva, was appointed professor of divinity there
in 1536. But being afterwards obliged to retire from thence, on
account of a quarrel about the administration of the communion
to certain individuals, Calvin taught a French congregation at
Strasburgh. He may be considered as the founder of the Presbyterian
doctrine, differing from that of Luther in denying consubstantiation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and affirming, in a large extent, the doctrine of predestination,
founded upon election to grace. The poet proceeds to
describe the progress of this sect:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The citizens of Geneva, before they adopted the reformed religion,
were under the temporal, as well as the ecclesiastical, authority
of a bishop. But, in 1528, when they followed the example of
the city of Berne, in destroying images, and abolishing the Roman
ceremonies, the bishop and his clergy were expelled from the
city, which from that time was considered as the cradle of Presbytery.
As they had made choice of a republican form of government
for their little state, our author infers, that democracy
is most congenial to their new form of religion. It is no doubt
true, that the Presbyterian church government is most purely democratical;
which perhaps recommended it in Holland. It is also
true, that the Presbyterian divines have always preached, and their
followers practised, the doctrine of resistance to oppression, whether
affecting civil or religious liberty. But if Dryden had looked
to his own times, he would have seen, that the Scottish Presbyterians
made a very decided stand for monarchy after the death of
Charles I.; and even such as were engaged in the conspiracy of
Baillie of Jerviswood, which was in some respects the counter-part
of the Ryehouse-plot, refused to take arms, because they suspected
that the intentions of Sidney, and others of the party in England,
were to establish a commonwealth. I may add, that, in latter
times, no body of men have shewn themselves more attached to the
king and constitution than the Presbyterian clergy of Scotland.</p>

<p>There is room for criticism also in the poetry of these lines.
I question whether <em>fenny Holland</em> and <em>fruitful Tweed</em>, in other
words, a marsh and a river, could form a favourable medium for
communicating the influence of the <em>quickening fire below</em>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how readily sentiments of toleration occur,
even to the professors of the most intolerant religion, when their
minds have fair play to attend to them. The edict of Nantes,
by which Henry IV. secured to his Huguenot subjects the undisturbed
exercise of their religion, was the recompense of the
great obligations he owed to them, and a sort of compensation
for his having preferred power to conscience; an edict, declared
unalterable, and which had even been sanctioned by Louis
XIV. himself, so late as 1680, was, in 1685, finally abrogated.
The violence with which the persecution of the Protestants
was then pushed on, almost exceeds belief. The principal
and least violent mode of conversion, adopted by the king and
his minister Louvois, was by quartering upon those of the reformed
religion large parties of soldiers, who were licenced to
commit every outrage in their habitations short of rape and murder.
When, by this species of persecution, a Huguenot had been
once compelled to hear mass, he was afterwards treated as a relapsed
heretic, if he shewed the slightest disposition to resume the
religion in which he had been brought up. James II., in two
letters to the Prince of Orange, beseeching toleration for the regular
priests in Holland, fails not to condemn the conduct of
Louis towards his Protestant subjects; yet, with gross inconsistency,
or the deepest dissimulation, he was at the same time congratulating
Barillon on his Most Christian Majesty's care for the
conversion of his subjects, and hoping God would grant him the
favour of completing so great a work.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> And just so our author,
after blaming the persecution of the Huguenots, congratulates
Italy and Spain upon possessing such just and excellent laws, as
the rules of the inquisitorial church courts.</p>

distinguished themselves by the different names of Brownists, Families

<p>The poet alludes to the doctrine of the church of England concerning
the eucharist, thus expressed in the twenty-eighth article
of faith:</p>

<p>"The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that
Christians ought to have among themselves one to another, but
rather it is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death; insomuch,
that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive
the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of
Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood
of Christ.</p>

<p>"Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread
and wine, in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy
writ; but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth
the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occasion to
many superstitions.</p>

<p>"The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the supper
only, after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean,
whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the supper, is
faith."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Dryden insists upon a supposed inconsistency in this doctrine;
but his argument recoils upon the creed of his own church. The
words of our Saviour are to be interpreted as they must have been
meant when spoken; a circumstance which excludes the literal
interpretation contended for by the Romanists: For, by the words
"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hoc est corpus meum</i>," our Saviour cannot be then supposed to
have meant, that the morsel which he gave to his disciples was
transformed into his body, which then stood before their eyes, and
which all but heretics allow to have been a real, natural, human
body, incapable, of course, of being multiplied into as many bodies
as there were persons to partake of the communion, and of
retaining its original and identical form at the same time. But
unless such a multiplied transformation actually took place, our
Saviour's words to his apostles must have been emblematical only.
Queen Elizabeth's homely lines are, after all, an excellent comment
on this point of divinity:</p>

<p>The pretensions of the church of England to loyalty were carried
to a degree of extravagance, which her divines were finally
unable to support, unless they had meant to sign the destruction
of their religion. This was owing to the recollection of the momentous
period which had lately elapsed. The interest of the
church had been deeply interwoven with that of the crown; their
struggle, sufferings, and fall, during the civil wars, had been in common,
as well as their triumphant restoration: the maxim of "no
king no bishop," was indelibly imprinted on the hearts of the clergy;
in fine, it seemed impossible that any thing should cut asunder
the ties which combined them. In sanctioning, therefore, the doctrines
of the most passive loyalty, the English divines probably
thought that they were only paying a tribute to the throne, which
was to be returned by the streams of royal bounty and grace towards
the church. Even the religion of James did not, before his
accession, shake their confidence, or excite their apprehensions.
They were far more afraid of the fanatics, under whose iron yoke
they had so lately groaned, than of the Roman Catholics, who, for
three generations, had been a depressed, and therefore a tractable
body, whose ceremonies and church government resembled, in
some respects, their own, and who had sided with them during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
civil wars against the Protestant sectaries. But when the members
of the established church perceived, that the rapid steps which
James adopted would soon place the Catholics in a condition to
rival, and perhaps to overpower her, they were obliged to retract
and explain away many of their former hasty expressions of absolute
and unconditional devotion to the royal pleasure. The king,
and his Catholic counsellors, saw with astonishment and indignation,
that professions of the most ample subjection were now to
be understood as limited and restricted by the interests of the
church. In the height of their resentment, even the church of
England's pretensions to a peculiar degree of loyalty were unthankfully
turned into ridicule, in such bitter and sarcastic terms
as the following, which occur in a pamphlet published expressly
"with allowance," <em>i. e.</em> by royal permission.</p>

<p>"I have often considered, but could never yet find a convincing
reason, why that part of the nation, (which is commonly
called the church of England) should dare appropriate to themselves
alone the principles of true loyalty; and that no other
church or communion on earth can be consistent with monarchy,
or, indeed, with any government.</p>

<p>"This is a presumption of so high a nature, that it renders the
church of England a despicable enemy to the rest of mankind:
For, what can be more ridiculous than to say, that a congregation
of people, calling themselves a church, which cannot pretend to
an infallibility even in matters of faith, having, since their first institution,
made several fundamental changes of religious worship,
should, however, assume to themselves an inerribility in point of
civil obedience to the temporal magistrate? Or, what can be
more injurious than to aver, that no other sect or community on
earth, from the rising to the setting sun, can be capable of this
singular gift of loyalty? So that the church of England alone, (if
you have faith enough to believe her own testimony,) is that beautiful
spouse of Christ, holy in her doctrine, and infallible in her
duty to the supreme magistrate, whom (by a revelation peculiar
to herself) she owns both for her temporal and spiritual head.
But I doubt much, whether her <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipsa dixit</i> alone will pass current
with all the nations of the universe, without making further
search into the veracity of this bold assertion."</p>

<p>This name for the Wolf is taken from an ancient political satire,
called "Reynard the Fox;" in which an account is given of the
intrigues at the court of the Lion; the impeachment of the Fox;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his various wiles and escapes; finally, his conquering his accuser
in single combat. This ancient apologue was translated from the
German by the venerable Caxton, and published the 6th day of
June, 1481. It became very popular in England; and we derive
from it all the names commonly applied to animals in fable, as
Reynard the fox, Tybert the cat, Bruin the bear, Isgrim the wolf,
&amp;c. The original of this piece is still so highly esteemed in Germany,
that it was lately modernized by Goethé, and is published
among his "Neüe Schriften." It is probable that this ancient
satire might be the original of "Mother Hubbard's Tale," and
that Dryden himself may have had something of its plan in his
eye, when writing "The Hind and Panther." As it had become
merely a popular story-book, some of his critics did not fail to
make merry with his adopting any thing from such a source.
"<cite>Smith.</cite> I have heard you quote Reynard the fox.&mdash;<cite>Bayes.</cite> Why,
there's it now; take it from me, Mr Smith, there is as good morality,
and as sound precepts, in The Delectable History of Reynard
the Fox, as in any book I know, except Seneca. Pray, tell me,
where, in any other author, could I have found so pretty a name

<p>The author here prefers an argument much urged by the Catholic
divines against those of the church of England, and which
he afterwards resumes in the Second Part. The English divines,
say they, halt between two opinions; they will not allow the
weight of tradition when they dispute with the church of Rome,
but refer to the scripture, interpreted by each man's private opinion,
as the sole rule of faith; while, on the other hand, they are
obliged to have recourse to tradition in their disputes with the
Presbyterians and dissenters, because, without its aid, they could
not vindicate from scripture alone their hierarchy and church-government.
To this it was answered, by the disputants on the
church of England's side, that they owned no such inconsistent
opinion as was imputed to them; but that they acknowledged, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
their rule of faith, the word of God in general; that by this
they understood the <em>written word</em>, or <em>scripture</em>, in contradistinction
to the Roman rule of scripture and traditions; and as distinguished,
both from the church of Rome, and from heretics and sectaries,
they understood by it more particularly the written word
or scripture, delivering a sense, owned and declared by the primitive
church of Christ in the three creeds, four first general councils,
and harmony of the fathers.</p>

<p>Dryden's argument, however, had been, by the Catholics,
thought so sound, that it is much dwelt upon in a tract, called,
"A Remonstrance, by way of Address to both Houses of Parliament,
from the Church of England," the object of which is to
recommend an union between the churches of England and of
Rome. The former is there represented as holding the following
language:</p>

<p>"You cannot be ignorant, that ever since my separation from
the church of Rome, I have been attacked by all sorts of dissenters:
So that my fate, in this encounter, may be compared to that
of a city, besieged by different armies, who fight both against it and
one another; where, if the garrison make a sally to damage one,
another presently takes an advantage to make an attack. Thus,
whilst I set myself vigorously to suppress the papist, the puritan
seeks to undermine me; and, whilst I am busied to oppose the puritan,
the papist gains ground upon me. If I tell the church of
Rome, I did not forsake her, but her errors, which I reformed;
my rebellious subjects tell me the same, and that they must make
a thorough reformation; and, let me bring what arguments I
please, to justify my dissent, they still produce the same against
me. If, on the other hand, I plead against the puritan dissenter,
and show, that he ought to stand to church-authority, where he is
not infallibly certain it commands a sin; the papist presently
catches at it, and tells me, I destroy my own grounds of reformation,
unless I will pretend to that infallibility which I condemn in
them.</p>

<p>"Matters standing thus betwixt me and them, why would it
not be a point of prudence in me, (as I doubt not but you would
esteem it in a governor of that city I lately mentioned,) to make
peace with one of my adversaries, to the end I may with more ease
resist the onsets of the other?"</p>

  <div class="i0">No, sure; to that the rebel would not yield;</div>
  <div class="i0">Squadrons of texts he marshalled in the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">That was but civil war, an equal set,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where piles with piles, and eagles eagles met.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">With texts point-blank and plain he faced the foe,</div>
  <div class="i0">And did not Satan tempt our Saviour so?</div>
  <div class="i0">The good old bishops took a simpler way;</div>
  <div class="i0">Each asked but what he heard his father say,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or how he was instructed in his youth,</div>
  <div class="i0">And by tradition's force upheld the truth.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></div>
  <div class="i1">The Panther smiled at this;&mdash;And when, said she,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were those first councils disallowed by me?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or where did I at sure tradition strike,</div>
  <div class="i0">Provided still it were apostolic?<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></div>
  <div class="i1">Friend, said the Hind, you quit your former ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where all your faith you did on scripture found:</div>
  <div class="i0">Now 'tis tradition joined with holy writ;</div>
  <div class="i0">But thus your memory betrays your wit.</div>
  <div class="i1">No, said the Panther; for in that I view,</div>
  <div class="i0">When your tradition's forged, and when 'tis true.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">I set them by the rule, and, as they square,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Or deviate from undoubted doctrine there,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">This oral fiction, that old faith declare.&mdash;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i1"><em>Hind.</em> The council steered, it seems, a different course;</div>
  <div class="i0">They tried the scripture by tradition's force:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">But you tradition by the scripture try;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Pursued by sects, from this to that you fly,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Nor dare on one foundation to rely.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">The word is then deposed, and in this view,</div>
  <div class="i0">You rule the scripture, not the scripture you.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus said the dame, and, smiling, thus pursued:</div>
  <div class="i0">I see, tradition then is disallowed,</div>
  <div class="i0">When not evinced by scripture to be true,</div>
  <div class="i0">And scripture, as interpreted by you.</div>
  <div class="i0">But here you tread upon unfaithful ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless you could infallibly expound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which you reject as odious popery,</div>
  <div class="i0">And throw that doctrine back with scorn on me.</div>
  <div class="i0">Suppose we on things traditive divide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And both appeal to scripture to decide;</div>
  <div class="i0">By various texts we both uphold our claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay, often, ground our titles on the same:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">After long labour lost, and time's expence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Both grant the words, and quarrel for the sense.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus all disputes for ever must depend;</div>
  <div class="i0">For no dumb rule can controversies end.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, when you said,&mdash;Tradition must be tried</div>
  <div class="i0">By sacred writ, whose sense yourselves decide,</div>
  <div class="i0">You said no more, but that yourselves must be</div>
  <div class="i0">The judges of the scripture sense, not we.</div>
  <div class="i0">Against our church-tradition you declare,</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet your clerks would sit in Moses' chair;</div>
  <div class="i0">At least 'tis proved against your argument,</div>
  <div class="i0">The rule is far from plain, where all dissent.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">If not by scriptures, how can we be sure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Replied the Panther, what tradition's pure?</div>
  <div class="i0">For you may palm upon us new for old;</div>
  <div class="i0">All, as they say, that glitters, is not gold.</div>
  <div class="i1">How but by following her, replied the dame,</div>
  <div class="i0">To whom derived from sire to son they came;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where every age does on another move,</div>
  <div class="i0">And trusts no farther than the next above;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where all the rounds like Jacob's ladder rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lowest hid in earth, the topmost in the skies?</div>
  <div class="i1">Sternly the savage did her answer mark,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her glowing eye-balls glittering in the dark,</div>
  <div class="i0">And said but this:&mdash;Since lucre was your trade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis dangerous climbing: To your sons and you</div>
  <div class="i0">I leave the ladder, and its omen too.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></div>
  <div class="i1"><em>Hind.</em> The Panther's breath was ever famed for sweet;</div>
  <div class="i0">But from the Wolf such wishes oft I meet.</div>
  <div class="i0">You learned this language from the Blatant Beast,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Or rather did not speak, but were possessed.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">As for your answer, 'tis but barely urged:</div>
  <div class="i0">You must evince tradition to be forged;</div>
  <div class="i0">Produce plain proofs; unblemished authors use</div>
  <div class="i0">As ancient as those ages they accuse;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till when, 'tis not sufficient to defame;</div>
  <div class="i0">An old possession stands, till elder quits the claim.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then for our interest, which is named alone</div>
  <div class="i0">To load with envy, we retort your own;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, when traditions in your faces fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolving not to yield, you must decry.</div>
  <div class="i0">As when the cause goes hard, the guilty man</div>
  <div class="i0">Excepts, and thins his jury all he can;</div>
  <div class="i0">So when you stand of other aid bereft,</div>
  <div class="i0">You to the twelve apostles would be left.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your friend the Wolf did with more craft provide</div>
  <div class="i0">To set those toys, traditions, quite aside;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">And fathers too, unless when, reason spent,</div>
  <div class="i0">He cites them but sometimes for ornament.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, madam Panther, you, though more sincere,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are not so wise as your adulterer;</div>
  <div class="i0">The private spirit is a better blind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than all the dodging tricks your authors find.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">For they, who left the scripture to the crowd,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Each for his own peculiar judge allowed;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">The way to please them was to make them proud.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Thus with full sails they ran upon the shelf;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who could suspect a cozenage from himself?</div>
  <div class="i0">On his own reason safer 'tis to stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than be deceived and damned at second-hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">But you, who fathers and traditions take,</div>
  <div class="i0">And garble some, and some you quite forsake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pretending church-authority to fix,</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet some grains of private spirit mix,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Are, like a mule, made up of different seed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And that's the reason why you never breed;</div>
  <div class="i0">At least, not propagate your kind abroad,</div>
  <div class="i0">For home dissenters are by statutes awed.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet they grow upon you every day,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">While you, to speak the best, are at a stay,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">For sects, that are extremes, abhor a middle way:<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Like tricks of state, to stop a raging flood,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Or mollify a mad-brained senate's mood;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Of all expedients never one was good.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Well may they argue, nor can you deny,</div>
  <div class="i0">If we must fix on church authority,</div>
  <div class="i0">Best on the best, the fountain, not the flood;</div>
  <div class="i0">That must be better still, if this be good.</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall she command, who has herself rebelled?</div>
  <div class="i0">Is antichrist by antichrist expelled?</div>
  <div class="i0">Did we a lawful tyranny displace,</div>
  <div class="i0">To set aloft a bastard of the race?</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Why all these wars to win the book, if we<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Must not interpret for ourselves, but she?<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Either be wholly slaves, or wholly free.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">For purging fires traditions must not fight;</div>
  <div class="i0">But they must prove episcopacy's right.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, those led horses are from service freed;</div>
  <div class="i0">You never mount them but in time of need.</div>
  <div class="i0">Like mercenaries, hired for home defence,</div>
  <div class="i0">They will not serve against their native prince.</div>
  <div class="i0">Against domestic foes of hierarchy</div>
  <div class="i0">These are drawn forth, to make fanatics fly;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">But, when they see their countrymen at hand,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Marching against them under church-command,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Straight they forsake their colours, and disband.&mdash;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i1">Thus she; nor could the Panther well enlarge</div>
  <div class="i0">With weak defence against so strong a charge;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">But said:&mdash;For what did Christ his word provide,</div>
  <div class="i0">If still his church must want a living guide?</div>
  <div class="i0">And if all-saving doctrines are not there,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or sacred penmen could not make them clear,</div>
  <div class="i0">From after-ages we should hope in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">For truths which men inspired could not explain.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">Before the word was written, said the Hind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our Saviour preached his faith to human kind:</div>
  <div class="i0">From his apostles the first age received</div>
  <div class="i0">Eternal truth, and what they taught believed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, by tradition faith was planted first,</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">This was the way our wise Redeemer chose,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Who sure could all things for the best dispose,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">To fence his fold from their encroaching foes.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">He could have writ himself, but well foresaw</div>
  <div class="i0">The event would be like that of Moses' law;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some difference would arise, some doubts remain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like those which yet the jarring Jews maintain.</div>
  <div class="i0">No written laws can be so plain, so pure,</div>
  <div class="i0">But wit may gloss, and malice may obscure;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not those indited by his first command,</div>
  <div class="i0">A prophet graved the text, an angel held his hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus faith was ere the written word appeared,</div>
  <div class="i0">And men believed not what they read, but heard.</div>
  <div class="i0">But since the apostles could not be confined</div>
  <div class="i0">To these, or those, but severally designed</div>
  <div class="i0">Their large commission round the world to blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">To spread their faith, they spread their labours too.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet still their absent flock their pains did share;</div>
  <div class="i0">They hearkened still, for love produces care.</div>
  <div class="i0">And as mistakes arose, or discords fell,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or bold seducers taught them to rebel,</div>
  <div class="i0">As charity grew cold, or faction hot,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or long neglect their lessons had forgot,</div>
  <div class="i0">For all their wants they wisely did provide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And preaching by epistles was supplied;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">So, great physicians cannot all attend,</div>
  <div class="i0">But some they visit, and to some they send.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet all those letters were not writ to all;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor first intended but occasional,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their absent sermons; nor, if they contain</div>
  <div class="i0">All needful doctrines, are those doctrines plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought</div>
  <div class="i0">They writ but seldom, but they daily taught;</div>
  <div class="i0">And what one saint has said of holy Paul,</div>
  <div class="i0">"He darkly writ," is true applied to all.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">For this obscurity could heaven provide<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">More prudently than by a living guide,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">As doubts arose, the difference to decide?<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">A guide was therefore needful, therefore made;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, if appointed, sure to be obeyed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, with due reverence to the apostles' writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">By which my sons are taught, to which submit,</div>
  <div class="i0">I think, those truths, their sacred works contain,</div>
  <div class="i0">The church alone can certainly explain;</div>
  <div class="i0">That following ages, leaning on the past,</div>
  <div class="i0">May rest upon the primitive at last.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor would I thence the word no rule infer,</div>
  <div class="i0">But none without the church-interpreter;</div>
  <div class="i0">Because, as I have urged before, 'tis mute,</div>
  <div class="i0">And is itself the subject of dispute.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">But what the apostles their successors taught,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">They to the next, from them to us is brought,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">The undoubted sense which is in scripture sought.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">From hence the church is armed, when errors rise,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">To stop their entrance, and prevent surprise;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And, safe entrenched within, her foes without defies.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">By these all festering sores her councils heal,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Which time or has disclosed, or shall reveal;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">For discord cannot end without a last appeal.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor can a council national decide,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">But with subordination to her guide:<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>

  <div class="i0">Before some judge appointed to decide.&mdash;</div>

<p>In these spirited lines, Dryden describes the dangers in which
the English Catholics were involved by the Popish Plot, which
rendered them so obnoxious for two years, that even Charles himself,
much as he was inclined to favour them, durst not attempt
to prevent the most severe measures from being adopted towards
them. It is somewhat curious, that the very same metaphor of
hounds and huntsmen is employed by one of the most warm advocates
for the plot. "Had this plot been a forged contrivance
of their own, (<em>i.e.</em> the Papists,) they would at the very first discovery
of it have had half a dozen, or half a score, crafty fellows,
ready to have attested all the same things; whereas, on the contrary,
notwithstanding we are now on a burning scent, we were
fain till here of late to pick out, by little and little, all upon a
cold scent, and that stained too by the tricks and malice of our
enemies. So that had we not had some such good huntsmen as
the Right Noble Earl of Shaftesbury, to manage the chase for us,

<p>The country party, during the 1679, and the succeeding years,
were as much incensed against the divines of the high church of
England as against the Papists. The furious pamphlet, quoted in
the last note, divides the enemies of this country into four classes;
officers, courtiers, over-hot churchmen, and papists. "Over-hot
churchmen," it continues, "are bribed to wish well to popery, by
the hopes, if not of a cardinal's cap, yet at least by a command
over some abbey, priory, or other ecclesiastical preferment whereof
the Romish church hath so great plenty. These are the men,
who exclaim against our parliament's proceedings, in relation to
the plot, as too violent, calling these times by no other name than
that of <em>forty</em> or <em>forty-one</em>;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> when, to amuse as well his sacred majesty
as his good people, they again threaten us with another <em>forty-eight</em>;
and all this is done to vindicate underhand the Catholic
party, by throwing a suspicion on the fanatics. These are the
gentlemen who so magnify the principles of Bishop Laud, and so
much extol the writings of that same late spirited prelate Dr Heylin,
who hath made more Papists, by his books than Christians by
his sermons. These are those episcopal Tantivies, who can make
even the very scriptures pimp for the court, who out of <em>Urim and
Thummim</em> can extort a sermon, to prove the not paying of tithes
and taxes to be the sin against the Holy Ghost; and had rather
see the kingdom run down with blood, than part with the least
hem of a sanctified frock, which they themselves made holy."&mdash;Appeal,
&amp;c. <cite>State Tracts</cite>, p. 403. In a very violent tract, written
expressly against the influence of the clergy,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> they are charged
with being the principal instruments of the court in corrupting
elections. "I find," says the author, when talking of the approaching
general election, "all persons very forward to countenance
this public work, except the high-flown ritualists and ceremony-mongers
of the clergy, who, being in the conspiracy against
the people, lay themselves out to accommodate their masters with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the veriest villains that can be picked up in all the country, that
so we may fall into the hands again of as treacherous and lewd a
parliament, as the wisdom of God and folly of man has most miraculously
dissolved. To which end they traduce all worthy
men for fanatics, schismatics, or favourers of them. Nay, do but
pitch upon a gentleman, who believes it his duty to serve his God,
his king, and country, faithfully, they cry him down as a person
dangerous and disaffected to the government; thinking thereby to
scare the people from the freedom of their choice, and then impose
their hair-brained journeymen and half-witted fops upon them."
In Shadwell's Whig play, called "The Lancashire Witches," he
has introduced an high-flying chaplain, as the expression then
run, and an Irish priest, who are described as very ready to accommodate
each other in all religious tenets, since they agree in
disbelieving the popish plot, and in believing that ascribed to the
fanatics. These, out of a thousand instances, may serve to show,
how closely the country party in the time of Charles II. were disposed
to identify the interests of Rome, and of the high church of
England. Dryden is therefore well authorised to say, that both
communions were aimed at by that cabal, which pushed on the
investigation of the supposed plot.</p>

<p>If there was any ambiguity in the church of England's doctrine
concerning the eucharist, it was fully explained by the memorable
Test Act, passed in 1678, during the heat of the Popish Plot, by
which all persons holding public offices were required, under pain
of disqualification, to disown the doctrine of transubstantiation,
in the most explicit terms, as also that of image worship. This
bill was pressed forwards with great violence by the country party.
"I would not," said one of their orators, "have a popishman,
or a popish woman, remain here; not a popish dog, or a
popish bitch; not so much as a popish cat, to pur and mew about
the king." Many of the church of England party opposed this
test, from an idea that it was prejudicial to the interests of the
crown.</p>

<p>Dryden does not plead the cause of infallibility so high as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>

and more moderate opinion, which vests it in the church and pope
jointly. This was the shape in which the doctrine was stated in
the pamphlets generally dispersed from the king's printing-press
about this time; whether because James really held the opinion of
the Ultramontane, or Gallican church, in this point, or that he
thought the more moderate statement was most likely to be acceptable
to new converts. In a dialogue betwixt a Missioner and
a Plain Man, printed along with the Rosary, in a very small form,
and apparently designed for very extensive circulation, the question
is thus stated:</p>

<p>"<em>Plain Man.</em> How shall I know what the church teaches, and
by what means may I come to know her infallible doctrine?</p>

<p>This ultimate appeal to the scriptures against the authority of
the church, as it is what the church of Rome has most to dread,
is most combated by her followers. Dryden, like a good courtier,
adopts here, as well as elsewhere, the arguments which converted
his master, Charles II. "We declare," says the king in his
first paper, "to believe one Catholic and apostolic church; and
it is not left to every phantastical man's head to believe as he
pleases, but to the church, to whom Christ left the power upon
earth, to govern us in matters of faith, who made these creeds for
our directions. It were a very irrational thing to make laws for
a country, and leave it to the inhabitants to be interpreters and
judges of those laws: For then every man will be his own judge;
and, by consequence, no such thing as either right or wrong.
Can we therefore suppose, that God Almighty would leave us at
those uncertainties, as to give us a rule to go by, and leave every
man to be his own judge? I do ask any ingenuous man, Whether
it be not the same thing to follow our own phancy, or to interpret
the scripture by it? I would have any man shew me, where
the power of deciding matters of faith is given to every particular
man. Christ left his power to his church, even to forgive sins in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
heaven; and left his Spirit with them, which they exercised after
his resurrection; first by his apostles in their creed, and many
years after by the council at Nice, where that creed was made
that is called by that name; and by the power which they had
received from Christ, they were the judges even of the scripture
itself many years after the apostles, which books were canonical,
and which were not." <cite>Papers found in King Charles's strong box.</cite></p>

<p>Dryden had previously attacked the rule of faith, by private
judgment of the Holy Scriptures. His assumption is, that the
scriptures having been often misunderstood and abused by heretics
of various descriptions, there must be some more infallible guide
left us by God as the rule of faith. Instead of trusting, therefore, to
individual judgment founded on the scripture, he urges, that the infallibility
of faith depends upon oral tradition, handed down, as his
communion pretends, by father to son, from the times of the primitive
church till this very day. It is upon this foundation that the
church of Rome rests her claim to infallibility, as the immediate
representative of the apostles and primitive church.</p>

<p>The doctrine of purgatory, and prayers for the dead, is founded
on a passage in the book of Tobit. The Apocrypha not being absolutely
rejected by the church of England, but admitted for
"example of life and instruction of manners," though not of canonical
authority, part of this curious and romantic history is read
in the course of the calendar. The domestic circumstance of the
dog gave unreasonable scandal to the Puritans, from which
the following is a good-humoured vindication. "Give me leave
for once to intercede for that poor dog, because he is a dog of
good example, for he was faithful, and loved his master; besides,
that he never troubles the church on Sundays, when people have
their best clothes on; only on a week-day, when scrupulous brethren
are always absent, the poor cur makes bold to follow his master."
But although the church of England did not receive the
traditive belief, founded upon the aforesaid passage concerning
prayer for the dead, the dissenters accused her of liberal reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to tradition in the disputes concerning the office of bishop, the nature
of which is in the New Testament left somewhat dubious.</p>

<p>Much of the preceding argument, and this conclusion, is founded
upon the following passage in the second paper found in King
Charles's strong box. "It is a sad thing to consider what a world
of heresies are crept into this nation. Every man thinks himself
as competent a judge of the scriptures as the very apostles themselves;
and 'tis no wonder that it should be so, since that part of
the nation which looks most like a church, dares not bring the true
arguments against the other sects, for fear they should be turned
against themselves, and confuted by their own arguments. The
church of England, as 'tis called, would fain have it thought, that
they are the judges in matters spiritual, and yet dare not positively
say, that there is no appeal from them; for either they must
say, that they are infallible, which they cannot pretend to, or
confess, that what they decide in matters of conscience is no further
to be followed, than as it agrees with every man's private
judgment."</p>

<p>To this the divines of England answered, that they indeed asserted
church authority, but without pretending to infallibility;
and that while the church decided upon points of faith, she was
to be directed and guided by the scriptures, just as the judges of a
temporal tribunal are to frame their decisions, not from any innate
or infallible authority of their own, but in conformity with
the laws of the realm.</p>

<p>In this and the following lines Dryden sets forth his adopted
mother-church in all the glowing attributes of majesty and authority.
The lines are extremely beautiful, and their policy is obvious,
from the following passage in a pretended letter from Father
Petre to Father La Chaise. The letter bears every mark indeed
of forgery; but it is equally an illustration of Dryden, whether
the policy contained in it was attributed by the Protestants
to the Catholics as part of their scheme, or was really avowed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
such by themselves. "Many English heretics resort often to our
sermons; and I have often recommended to our fathers to preach
now in the beginning as little as they can of the controversy, because
that provokes; but to represent to them the beauty and antiquity
of the Catholic religion, that they may be convinced that all
that has been said and preached to them, and their own reflections
concerning it, have been all scandal."&mdash;<cite>Somers' Tracts</cite>, p. 253. The
unity of the Catholic church was also chiefly insisted on during
the controversy:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">

  <div class="i0">Entire; one solid, shining diamond,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not sparkles shattered into sects like you;</div>
  <div class="i0">One is the church, and must be to be true.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It seems to have escaped Dryden, that all the various sects
which have existed, and do now exist, in the Christian world,
may, in some measure, be said to be sparkles shattered from his
"solid diamond;" since at one time all Christendom belonged to
the Roman church. Thus the disunion of the various sects of Protestants
is no more an argument against the church of England than
it is against the church of Rome, or the Christian faith in general.
All communions insist on the same privilege; and when the church
of Rome denounced the Protestants as heretics, like Coriolanus
going into exile, they returned the sentence against her who gave
it. If it is urged, that, notwithstanding these various defections,
the Roman church retained the most extended communion, this
plea would place the truth of religious opinions upon the hazardous
basis of numbers, which Mahometans might plead more successfully
than any Christian church, in proportion as their faith is more
widely extended. These arguments of the unity and extent of the
church are thus expressed in a missionary tract already quoted,
where the <em>Plain Man</em> thus addresses his English parson: "Either
shew me, by more plain and positive texts of scripture than what
the Missioner has here brought, that God Almighty has promised
to preserve his church from essential errors, such as are idolatry,
superstition, &amp;c.; or else shew me a church visible in all ages
spread over the face of the whole world, secured from such errors,
and at unity in itself. A church, that has had all along kings for
nursing fathers, and queens for nursing mothers; a church, to
which all nations have flowed, and which is authorised to teach
them infallibly all those truths which were delivered to the saints
without mixtures of error, which destroy sanctity; I say, either
shew me, from plain texts of scripture, that Christ's church was
not to be my infallible guide; or shew me such a church of Christ
as these promises require, distinct from that of the Roman, and
from which she has either separated, or been cut off."</p>

<p>The author has, a little above, used an argument, much to the
honour of the Catholic church&mdash;her unceasing diligence in labouring
for the conversion of the heathen; a task, in which her missionaries
have laboured with unwearied assiduity, encountering fatigue,
danger, and martyrdom itself, in winning souls to the faith.
It has been justly objected, that the spiritual instruction of their
converts is but slight and superficial; yet still their missionary
zeal forms a strong contrast to the indifference of the reformed
churches in this duty. Nothing of the kind has ever been attempted
on a great or national scale by the church of England,
which gives Catholics room to upbraid her clergy with their unambitious
sloth in declining the dignity of becoming bishops <em>in
partibus infidelium</em>. The poet goes on to state the scandalous materials
with which it has been the universal custom of Britain to
supply the population of her colonies; the very dregs and outcasts
of humanity being the only recruits whom she destines to
establish the future marts for her commodities. The success of
such missionaries among the savage tribes, who have the misfortune
to be placed in their vicinity, may be easily guessed:</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the care of the Catholic missionaries was
by no means limited to the spiritual concerns of those heathen
among whom they laboured: they extended them to their temporal
concerns, and sometimes unfortunately occasioned grievous
civil dissensions, and much bloodshed. Something of this kind
took place in Japan; where the Christians, having raised a rebellion
against the heathens, (for the beaten party, as Dryden says,
are always rebels to the victors,) were exterminated, root and branch.
This excited such an utter hatred of Catholic priests, and their
religion, that they were prohibited, under the deepest denunciations
of death and confiscation, from landing in Japan. Nevertheless,
the severity of this law did not prevent the Hollanders from sharing
in the gainful traffic of the island, which they gained permission
to do, by declaring, that they were not Christians, (only
meaning, we hope, that they were not Catholics,) but Dutchmen;
and it was currently believed, that, in corroboration of their assertion,
they were required to trample upon the crucifix, the object
of adoration to those whom the Japanese had formerly known
under the name of Christians.</p>

<p>The English Benedictine monks executed a renunciation of
the abbey lands, belonging to the order before the Reformation,
in order to satisfy the minds of the possessors, and reconcile them
to the re-establishment of the ancient religion, by guaranteeing
the stability of their property. There appeared, however, to the
proprietors of these lands, little generosity in this renunciation, in
case the monks were to remain in a condition of inability to support
their pretended claim; and, on the other hand, some reason
to suspect its validity, should they ever be strong enough to plead
their title. The king's declaration of indulgence contained a promise
upon this head, which appeared equally ominous: He declared,
that he would maintain his loving subjects in their properties
and possessions, "as well of church and abbey lands as of
any other." The only effect of this clause was to make men
enquire, whether popery was so near being established as to
make such a promise necessary; and if so, how far the promise
itself was to be relied upon, in opposition to the doctrine of resumption,
which had always been enforced by the Roman see,
even when these church lands fell into the hands of persons of
their own persuasion, unless they were dedicated to pious uses.
Nor were there wanting persons to remind the proprietors of such
lands, that the canons declared that even the pope had no authority
to confirm the alienation of the property of the church; that
the general council of Trent had solemnly anathematized all who
detained church lands; that the <cite>Monasticon Anglicanum</cite> was carefully
preserved in the Vatican as a rule for the intended resumption;
and that the reigning pope had obstinately refused to confirm
any such alienations by his bulls, though the doing so at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
crisis might have removed a great obstacle to the growth of Popery
in England.&mdash;See, in the <cite>State Tracts</cite>, a piece called "Abbey Lands
not assured to Roman Catholics," Vol. 1. p. 326; and more especially
a tract, by some ascribed to Burnet, and by others to Sir
William Coventry, entitled, "A Letter written to Dr Burnet, giving
some account of Cardinal Pole's secret powers; from which
it appears, that it never was intended to confirm the Alienation
that was made of the Abbey Lands. To which are added, Two
Breves that Cardinal Pole brought over, and some other of his
Letters that were never before printed, 1685."</p>

<p>The aurora borealis was an uncommon spectacle in England
during the 17th century. Its occasional appearance, however,
gave foundation to those tales of armies fighting in the air, and
similar phenomena with which the credulity of the vulgar was
amused. The author seems to allude to some extraordinary display
of the aurora borealis on the evening of the battle of Sedgemuir,
which was chiefly fought by night. I do not find the circumstance
noticed elsewhere. Dryden attests it by his personal
evidence.</p>

<p>This seems to be a sarcasm of the same kind with the following:
"But," says the zealous Protestant of the mother church, "if
you repeal the test, you take away the bulwark that defends the
church; for if that were once demolished, the enemy would rush
in and possess all; and it is a delicate innocent church that cannot
be safe but in a fortified place."&mdash;"I must confess, it is a great
argument of her modesty to own herself weak and unable to subsist
without the support of parliamentary laws, to hang, draw, or
quarter her opposers, and without a coercive power in herself to
fine and excommunicate all recusants and nonconformists."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> One

  <div class="i1">With these the Martin readily concurred,</div>
  <div class="i0">A church bigot, and church-believing bird;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Of little body, but of lofty mind,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Round bellied, for a dignity designed,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And much a dunce, as Martins are by kind;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet often quoted canon-laws, and code,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And fathers which he never understood;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">But little learning needs in noble blood.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">For, sooth to say, the Swallow brought him in,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her household chaplain, and her next of kin;</div>
  <div class="i0">In superstition silly to excess,</div>
  <div class="i0">And casting schemes by planetary guess;</div>
  <div class="i0">In fine, short-winged, unfit himself to fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">His fear foretold foul weather in the sky.</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, a Raven from a withered oak,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Left of their lodging, was observed to croak.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">That omen liked him not; so his advice<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Was present safety, bought at any price;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">A seeming pious care, that covered cowardice.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">To strengthen this, he told a boding dream,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of rising waters, and a troubled stream,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sure signs of anguish, dangers, and distress,</div>
  <div class="i0">With something more, not lawful to express:</div>
  <div class="i0">By which he slily seemed to intimate</div>
  <div class="i0">Some secret revelation of their fate.</div>
  <div class="i0">For he concluded, once upon a time,</div>
  <div class="i0">He found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose antique characters did well denote</div>
  <div class="i0">The Sibyl's hand of the Cumæan grot;</div>
  <div class="i0">The mad divineress had plainly writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">A time should come, but many ages yet,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">In which, sinister destinies ordain,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">A dame should drown with all her feathered train,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>

  <div class="i0">At this, some shook for fear; the more devout</div>
  <div class="i0">Arose, and blessed themselves from head to foot.</div>
  <div class="i1">'Tis true, some stagers of the wiser sort</div>
  <div class="i0">Made all these idle wonderments their sport;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">They said, their only danger was delay,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And he, who heard what every fool could say,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Would never fix his thought, but trim his time away.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">The passage yet was good; the wind, 'tis true,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Was somewhat high, but that was nothing new,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">No more than usual equinoxes blew.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">The sun, already from the Scales declined,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Gave little hopes of better days behind,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">But change from bad to worse, of weather and of wind.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor need they fear the dampness of the sky<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Should flag their wings, and hinder them to fly,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas only water thrown on sails too dry.<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">But, least of all, philosophy presumes</div>
  <div class="i0">Of truth in dreams, from melancholy fumes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Perhaps the Martin, housed in holy ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Might think of ghosts, that walk their midnight round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till grosser atoms, tumbling in the stream</div>
  <div class="i0">Of fancy, madly met, and clubbed into a dream:</div>
  <div class="i0">As little weight his vain presages bear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of ill effect to such alone who fear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Most prophecies are of a piece with these,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each Nostradamus can foretel with ease:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Not naming persons, and confounding times,</div>
  <div class="i0">One casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes.</div>
  <div class="i1">The advice was true; but fear had seized the most,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all good counsel is on cowards lost.</div>
  <div class="i0">The question crudely put to shun delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas carried by the major part to stay.</div>
  <div class="i1">His point thus gained, Sir Martin dated thence</div>
  <div class="i0">His power, and from a priest became a prince.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">He ordered all things with a busy care,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And cells and refectories did prepare,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And large provisions laid of winter fare;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0">But, now and then, let fall a word or two,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Of hope, that heaven some miracle might show,<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And for their sakes, the sun should backward go;<span class="smallbrace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Against the laws of nature upward climb,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, mounted on the Ram, renew the prime;</div>
  <div class="i0">For which two proofs in sacred story lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Ahaz' dial, and of Joshua's day.</div>
  <div class="i0">In expectation of such times as these,</div>
  <div class="i0">A chapel housed them, truly called of ease;</div>
  <div class="i0">For Martin much devotion did not ask;</div>
  <div class="i0">They prayed sometimes, and that was all their task.</div>
  <div class="i1">It happened, as beyond the reach of wit</div>
  <div class="i0">Blind prophecies may have a lucky hit,</div>
  <div class="i0">That this accomplished, or at least in part,</div>

<p>The poet, in the beginning of this canto, anticipates the censure
of those who might blame him for introducing into his fables animals
not natives of Britain, where the scene was laid. He vindicates
himself by the example of Æsop and Spenser. The latter,
in "Mother Hubbard's Tale," exhibits at length the various arts
by which, in his time, obscure and infamous characters rose to eminence
in church and state. This is illustrated by the parable of
an Ape and a Fox, who insinuate themselves into various situations,
and play the knaves in all. At length,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Lo, where they spied, how, in a gloomy glade,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Lion, sleeping, lay in secret shade;</div>
  <div class="i0">His crown and sceptre lying him beside,</div>
  <div class="i0">And having doft for heat his dreadful hide.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The adventurers possess themselves of the royal spoils, with
which the Ape is arrayed; who forthwith takes upon himself the
dignity of the monarch of the beasts, and, by the counsels of the
Fox, commits every species of oppression, until Jove, incensed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the disorders which his tyranny had introduced, sends Mercury to
awaken the Lion from his slumber:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Arise! said Mercury, thou sluggish beast,</div>
  <div class="i0">That here liest senseless, like the corpse deceast;</div>
  <div class="i0">The whilst thy kingdom from thy head is rent,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thy throne royal with dishonour blent.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Lion rouses himself, hastens to court, and avenges himself
of the usurpers.&mdash;There is no doubt, that, under this allegory,
Spenser meant to represent the exorbitant power of Lord Burleigh;
and he afterwards complains, that his verse occasioned his
falling into a "mighty peer's displeasure." The Lion, therefore,
whose negligence is upbraided by Mercury, was Queen Elizabeth.
Dryden calls her,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The queen, whose feast the factious rabble keep;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>because the tumultuous pope-burnings of 1680 and 1681 were solemnized
on Queen Elizabeth's night. The poet had probably,
since his change of religion, laid aside much of the hereditary
respect with which most Englishmen regard Queen Bess; for, in
the pamphlets of the Romanists, she is branded as "a known
bastard, who raised this prelatic protestancy, called the church of
England, as a prop to supply the weakness of her title."<a name="FNanchor_264_265" id="FNanchor_264_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_265" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Spenser's authority is only appealed to by Dryden as justifying
the introduction of lions and other foreign animals into a British
fable. But I observed in the introduction, that it also furnishes
authority, at least example, for those aberrations from the character
and attributes of his brute actors, with which the critics taxed
Dryden; for nothing in "The Hind and the Panther" can be
more inconsistent with the natural quality of such animals, than
the circumstance of a lion, or any other creature, going to sleep
without his skin, on account of the sultry weather.</p>

<p>During the latter years of the reign of Charles the Second, the
dissensions of the state began to creep into the church. By far
the greater part of the clergy, influenced by the ancient union of
church and king, were steady in their adherence to the court interest.
But a party began to appear, who were distinguished
from their brethren by the name of <em>Moderate Divines</em>, which they
assumed to themselves, and by that of Latitudinarians, which the
high churchmen conferred upon them. The chief amongst these
were Tillotson, Stillingfleet, and Burnet. They distinguished themselves
by a less violent ardour for the ceremonies, and even the
government, of the church; for all those particulars, in short, by
which she is distinguished from other Protestant congregations.
Stillingfleet carried these condescensions so far, as to admit in his
tract, called <em>Irenicum</em>, that, although the original church was settled
in a constitution of bishops, priests, and deacons, yet as the
apostles made no positive law upon this subject, it remained free
to every Christian congregation to alter or to retain that form of
church government. In conformity with this opinion, he, in conjunction
with Tillotson and others, laid a plan for an accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
with the Presbyterians, in 1668; and, in order to this comprehension,
he was willing to have made such sacrifices in the
point of ordination, &amp;c. that the House of Commons took the
alarm, and passed a vote, prohibiting even the introduction of a
bill for such a purpose. As, on the one hand, the tenets of the
moderate clergy approximated those of the Calvinists; so, on the
other, their antipathy and opposition to the church of Rome was
more deeply rooted, in proportion to the slighter value which they
attached to the particulars in which that of England resembled
her. It flowed naturally from this indulgence to the Dissenters,
and detestation of the Romanists, that several of the moderate
clergy participated deeply in the terrors excited by the Roman
Catholic plot, and looked with a favourable eye on the bill which
proposed to exclude the Duke of York from the throne as a professor
of that obnoxious religion. Being thus, as it were, an
opposition party, it cannot be supposed that the low church divines
united cordially with their high-flying brethren in renouncing
the right of resisting oppression, or in professing passive obedience
to the royal will. They were of opinion, that there was a
mutual compact between the king and subject, and that acts of
tyranny, on the part of the former, absolved the latter from his allegiance.
This was particularly inculcated by the reverend Samuel
Johnson (See Vol. IX. p. 369.) in "Julian the Apostate," and
other writings which were condemned by the Oxford decree. As
the dangers attending the church, from the measures of King James,
became more obvious, and the alternative of resistance or destruction
became an approaching crisis, the low church party acquired
numbers and strength from those who thought it better at once to
hold and assert the lawfulness of opposition to tyranny, than to
make professions of obedience beyond the power of human endurance
to make good.</p>

<p>This party was of course deeply hated by the Catholics, and
hence the severity with which they are treated by Dryden, who
objects to them as the illegitimate offspring of the Panther by the
Wolf, and traces to their Presbyterian origin their indifference to
the fasts and ascetic observances of the more rigid high-churchmen,
and their covert disposition to resist regal domination. Their
adherence to the English communion he ascribes only to the lucre
of gain, and endeavours, if possible, to draw an odious distinction between
them and the rest of the church. Stillingfleet, whom this
motive could not escape, had already complained of Dryden's designing
any particular class of the clergy by a party name. "From
the common people, we come to churchmen, to see how he uses
them. And he hath soon found out a faction among them, whom
he charges with juggling designs: but romantic heroes must be allowed
to make armies of a field of thistles, and to encounter windmills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for giants. He would fain be the instrument to divide our
clergy, and to fill them with suspicions of one another. And to
this end he talks of men of latitudinarian stamp: for it goes a
great way towards the making divisions, to be able to fasten a name
of distinction among brethren; this being to create jealousies of
each other. But there is nothing should make them more careful
to avoid such names of distinction, than to observe how ready
their common enemies are to make use of them, to create animosities
by them; which hath made this worthy gentleman to start
this different character of churchmen among us; as though there
were any who were not true to the principles of the church of
England, as by law established: If he knows them, he is better
acquainted with them than the answerer is; for he professes to
know none such. But who then are these men of the latitudinarian
stamp? To speak in his own language, they are a sort of ergoteerers,
who are for a <em>concedo</em> rather than a <em>nego</em>. And now, I
hope, they are all well explained; or, in other words of his, they
are, saith he, for drawing the nonconformists to their party, <em>i.e.</em>
they are for having no nonconformists. And is this their crime?
But they would take the headship of the church out of the king's
hands: How is that possible? They would (by his own description)
be glad to see differences lessened, and all that agree in the
same doctrine to be one entire body. But this is that which their
enemies fear, and this politician hath too much discovered; for
then such a party would be wanting, which might be played upon
the church of England, or be brought to join with others against
it. But how this should touch the king's supremacy, I cannot
imagine. As for his desiring loyal subjects to consider this matter,
I hope they will, and the more for his desiring it; and assure
themselves, that they have no cause to apprehend any juggling
designs of their brethren; who, I hope, will always show themselves
to be loyal subjects, and dutiful sons of the church of England."&mdash;<cite>Vindication

<p>The Huguenot clergy, who took refuge in England after the recal
of the edict of Nantes, did not all adhere to the same Protestant
communion. There had been long in London what was called the
Walloon church, exclusively dedicated to this sort of worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Many conformed to the church of England; and, having submitted
to new ordination, some of them obtained benefices: others
joined in communion with the Presbyterians, and dissenters of various
kinds. Dryden insinuates, that had the church of England
presented vacancies sufficient for the provision of these foreign divines,
she would probably have had the honour of attracting them
all within her pale. The reformed clergy of France were far
from being at any time an united body. "It might have been
expected," says Burnet, "that those unhappy contests between
Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, and Anti-Arminians, with some
minuter disputes that have enflamed Geneva and Switzerland,
should have been at least suspended while they had a common
enemy to deal with, against whom their whole force united was
scarce able to stand. But these things were carried on rather
with more eagerness and sharpness than ever." <cite>History of his

<p>The three steeples argent obviously alludes to the pluralities enjoyed,
perhaps by Stillingfleet, and certainly by some of the divines
of the established church, who were not on that account less
eager in opposing the intrusion of the Roman clergy, and stigmatising
those who, at this crisis, thought proper to conform
to the royal faith. These converts were neither numerous nor
respectable; and, whatever the Hind is pleased to allege in the
text, posterity cannot but suspect the disinterestedness of their
motives. Obadiah Walker, and a very few of the university
of Oxford, embraced the Catholic faith, conforming at the same
time to the forms of the church of England, as if they wished
to fulfil the old saying, of having two strings to one bow.&mdash;The
Earls of Perth and Melfort, with one or two other Scottish
nobles, took the same step. Of the first, who must otherwise
have failed in a contest which he had with the Duke of
Queensberry, it was wittily said by Halifax, that "his faith had
made him whole." And, in general, as my countrymen are not
usually credited by their brethren of England for an extreme disregard
to their own interest, the Scottish converts were supposed
to be peculiarly attracted to Rome by the miracle of the loaves
and fishes.<a name="FNanchor_265_266" id="FNanchor_265_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_266" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> But it may be said for these unfortunate peers, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
if they were dazzled by the momentary sunshine which gleamed

Lord Sunderland, if we suppose that he became a convert to Popery,
merely from views of immediate interest, and not with the
premeditated intention of blinding and betraying the monarch,
who trusted him. Dryden must be supposed, however, chiefly interested
in the vindication of his own motives for a change of religion.</p>

<p>Dryden here puts into the mouth of the Panther some of the
severe language which Stillingfleet had held towards him in the
ardour of controversy. He had, in direct allusion to our author,
(for he quotes his poetry,) expressed himself thus harshly:</p>

<p>"If I thought there were no such thing in the world as true
religion, and that <em>the priests of all religions are alike</em>,<a name="FNanchor_266_267" id="FNanchor_266_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_267" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> I might
have been as nimble a convert, and as early a defender of the
royal papers, as any one of these champions. For why should not
one who believes no religion, declare for any? But since I do
verily believe, that not only there is such a thing as true religion,
but that it is only to be found in the books of the Holy Scripture,
I have reason to inquire after the best means of understanding
such books, and thereby, if it may be, to put an end to the controversies
of Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_267_268" id="FNanchor_267_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_268" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>"But our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grim logician</i> proceeds from immediate and original
to concomitant causes, which he saith were revenge, ambition, and
covetousness. But the skill of logicians used to lie in proving;
but this is not our author's talent, for not a word is produced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that purpose. If bold sayings, and confident declarations, will
do the business, he is never unprovided; but if you expect any

character of a grim logician suits with his inclination."<a name="FNanchor_268_269" id="FNanchor_268_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_269" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Again,
"But if I will not allow his affirmations for proofs for his part, he
will act the grim logician; no, and in truth it becomes him so ill,
that he doth well to give it over."<a name="FNanchor_269_270" id="FNanchor_269_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_270" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> And in the beginning of his
"Vindication," alluding to a term used by the defender of the
king's papers, Stillingfleet says: "But lest I be again thought to
have a mind to flourish before I offer to pass, as the champion

<p>This is a continuation of the allusion to Stillingfleet's "Vindication,"
who had attempted to place Henry VIII.'s divorce from
Catherine of Arragon to the account of his majesty's tender conscience.
A herculean task! but the readers may take it in the
words of the Dean of St Paul's:</p>

<p>"And now this gentleman sets himself to <em>ergoteering</em>;<a name="FNanchor_271_272" id="FNanchor_271_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_272" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and
looks and talks like any grim logician, of the causes which produced
it, and the effects which it produced. 'The schism led the
way to the Reformation, for breaking the unity of Christ's church,
which was the foundation of it: but the immediate cause of this,
which produced the separation of Henry VIII. from the church
of Rome, was the refusal of the pope to grant him a divorce from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
his first wife, and to gratify his desires in a dispensation for a second
marriage.'</p>

<p>"<em>Ergo</em>: The first cause of the Reformation, was the satisfying
an inordinate and brutal passion. But is he sure of this? If he be
not, it is a horrible calumny upon our church, upon King Henry
the Eighth, and the whole nation, as I shall presently show.
No; he confesses he cannot be sure of it: for, saith he, no man
can carry it so high as the original cause with any certainty.
And at the same time, he undertakes to demonstrate the immediate
cause to be Henry the Eighth's inordinate and brutal passion;
and afterwards affirms, as confidently as if he had demonstrated
it, that our Reformation was erected on the foundations
of lust, sacrilege, and usurpation: Yet, saith he, the king
only knew whether it was conscience or love, or love alone,
which moved him to sue for a divorce. Then, by his favour, the
king only could know what was the immediate cause of that
which he calls the schism. Well! but he offers at some probabilities,
that lust was the true cause. Is Ergoteering come to this
already? 'But this we may say, if Conscience had any part in it,
she had taken a long nap of almost twenty years together before she
awakened.' Doth he think, that Conscience doth not take a longer
nap than this in some men, and yet they pretend to have it truly
awakened at last? What thinks he of late converts? Cannot they
be true, because conscience hath slept so long in them? Must we
conclude in such cases, that some inordinate passion gives conscience
a jog at last? 'So that it cannot be denied, he saith, that
an inordinate and brutal passion had a great share at least in the
production of the schism.' How! cannot be denied! I say from
his own words it ought to be denied, for he confesses none could
know but the king himself; he never pretended that the king confessed
it: How then cannot it be denied? Yea, how dare any one
affirm it? Especially when the king himself declared in a solemn
assembly, in these words, saith Hall, (as near, saith he, as I could
carry them away,) speaking of the dissatisfaction of his conscience,&mdash;"For
this only cause, I protest before God, and in the
word of a prince, I have asked counsel of the greatest clerks in
Christendom; and for this cause I have sent for this legat, as a
man indifferent, only to know the truth, and to settle my conscience,
and for none other cause, as God can judge." And both
then and afterwards, he declared, that his scruples began upon the
French ambassador's making a question about the legitimacy of
the marriage, when the match was proposed between the Duke of
Orleans and his daughter; and he affirms, that he moved it himself
in confession to the Bishop of Lincoln, and appeals to him
concerning the truth of it in open court."&mdash;<cite>Vindication of the Answer

<p>Stillingfleet concludes his "Vindication" with this admonition
to Dryden: "I would desire him not to end with such a bare-faced
assertion of a thing so well known to be false, viz. that there
is not one original treatise written by a Protestant, which hath
handled distinctly, and by itself, that Christian virtue of humility.
Since within a few years (besides what hath been printed formerly)
such a book hath been published in London. But he doth well
to bring it off with, 'at least that I have seen or heard of;' for such
books have not lain much in the way of his inquiries. Suppose
we had not such particular books, we think the Holy Scripture
gives the best rules and examples of humility of any book in the
world; but I am afraid he should look on his case as desperate
if I send him to the Scripture, since he saith, 'Our divines do
that as physicians do with their patients whom they think uncurable,
send them at last to Tunbridge-waters, or to the air of
Montpellier."</p>

<p>Dryden, in the Introduction, says, that the author of this work
was called Duncombe; but he is charged with inaccuracy by
Montague, who says his name is Allen. It seems to be admitted,
that his work is a translation from the Spanish. The real author
may have been Thomas Allen, rector of Kettering, in Northamptonshire,
and author of "The Practice of a Holy Life, 8vo. 1716;"
in the list of books subjoined to which, I find "The Virtue of Humility,
recommended to be printed by the late reverend and learned
Dr Henry Hammond," which perhaps may be the book in
question. A sort of similarity of sound between Duncombe and
Hammond may have led to Dryden's mistake. Alonzo Rodriguez,
of the Order of the Jesuits, wrote a book called "<em>Exercicio
de perfecion y virtudes Christianas, Sevilla, 1609</em>," which seems
to be the work from which the plagiary was taken.</p>

<p>Our author, in the preceding lines, had employed himself in repelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the charge of his having changed his religion for the sake
of interest. His loaves, he says, had not been increased by the
change, nor had his assiduity at court intimated any claim upon
royal favour: and in reference to her neglect of literary merit, he
charges on the church of England the fate of Butler, a brother
poet. Of that truly original genius we only know, that his life
was spent in dependence, and embittered by disappointment. But
unless Dryden alludes to some incident now unknown, it is difficult
to see how the church of England could have rewarded his
merit. Undoubtedly she owed much to his forcible satire against
her lately triumphant rivals, the Presbyterians and Independents;
but, unless Butler had been in orders, how could the
church have recompensed his poetical talents? The author of the
most witty poem that ever was written had a much more natural
and immediate claim upon the munificence of the wittiest king
and court that ever was in England; nor was his satire less serviceable
to royalty than to the established religion. The blame
of neglecting Butler lay therefore on Charles II. and his gay
courtiers, who quoted "Hudibras" incessantly, and left the author
to struggle with obscurity and indigence. The poet himself
has, in a fragment called "Hudibras at Court," set forth both
the kind reception which Charles gave the poem, and his neglect
of the author:</p>

<p>Our author here complains of the personal reflections which
Stillingfleet had cast upon him, particularly in the passage already
quoted in Note VII., where he is expressly charged with disbelieving
the existence of "such a thing as true religion." The second
and third lines of the triplet are somewhat obscure. The
meaning seems to be, that Dryden, conscious of having given the
first offence, which we shall presently see was the case, justifies
his having done so, from personal abuse being the never-failing resort
of the liberal clergy. The application of the neuter pronoun
<em>it</em> to the liberal clergy, is probably in imitation of Virgil's satirical
construction:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Varium et mutabile semper fæmina.</i></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It happened in this controversy, as in most others, that both
parties, laying out of consideration the provocation which they
themselves had given, complained bitterly of the illiberality of
their antagonists. Stillingfleet expatiates on the unhandsome
language contained in Dryden's Defence, and the passages which
he quotes are those which contain the exposure of the liberal clergy
mentioned in the text:</p>

<p>"Yet as if I had been the sole contriver or inventor of all, he
bestows those civil and obliging epithets upon me, of <em>disingenuous</em>,
<em>foul-mouthed</em>, and <em>shuffling</em>; one of a <em>virulent genius</em>, of <em>spiteful
diligence</em>, and <em>irreverence to the royal family</em>; of <em>subtle calumny</em>,
and <em>sly aspersion</em>; and he adds to these ornaments of speech, that
I have a <em>cloven-foot</em>, and my name is <em>Legion</em>; and that my Answer
is an <em>infamous libel</em>, a <em>scurrilous saucy pamphlet</em>. Is this indeed
the spirit of a new convert? Is this the meekness and temper
you intend to gain proselytes by, and to convert the nation? He
tells us in the beginning, that truth has a language peculiar to itself:
I desire to be informed, whether these be any of the characters
of it? And how the language of reproach and evil-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
may be distinguished from it? But zeal in a new convert is a terrible
thing; for it not only burns, but rages, like the eruptions of
Mount Ætna; it fills the air with noise and smoke, and throws out
such a torrent of liquid fire, that there is no standing before it.
The Answer alone was too mean a sacrifice for such a Hector in
controversy. All that standeth in his way must fall at his feet.
He calls me Legion, that he may be sure to have number enough
to overcome. But he is a great proficient indeed, if he be such an
exorcist, to cast out a whole legion already. But he hopes it may
be done without fasting and prayer."&mdash;<cite>Vindication of the Answer</cite>,

<p>The Hind having shewn that her influence over Dryden was
such as to induce him to submit patiently, and without vengeance,
to injury and reproach, now calls upon the Panther to exert her
authority in turn over Stillingfleet, for his irreverend attack upon
the royal papers in favour of the Catholic religion. Upon a careful
perusal of the Answers and Vindication of that great divine, it
is impossible to find any grounds for the charge of his having <em>reviled</em>
Charles II. or the Duchess of York; on the contrary, their
names are always mentioned with great respect, and the controversy
is conducted strictly in conformity with the following spirited
advertisement prefixed to the Answer:</p>

<p>"If the papers, here answered, had not been so publicly dispersed
through the nation, a due respect to the name they bear,
would have kept the author from publishing any answer to them.
But because they may now fall into many hands, who, without
some assistance, may not readily resolve some difficulties started
by them, he thought it not unbecoming his duty to God and the
king, to give a clearer light to the things contained in them. And
it can be no reflection on the authority of a prince, for a private
subject to examine a piece of coin as to its just value, though it
bears his image and superscription upon it. In matters that concern
faith and salvation, we must prove all things, and hold fast
that which is good."&mdash;<cite>Advertisement to Answer to the Royal Papers.</cite></p>

<p>Dryden, however, like the other Catholics, was pleased to interpret
the impugning and confuting the arguments used by the
king and duchess, into contempt and disrespect for their persons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
It was this forced construction on which was founded the prosecution
of Sharpe and of the Bishop of London before the ecclesiastical
commissioners. Sharpe having been defied to a polemical
contest, by a paper handed into his pulpit, took occasion to
preach on the arguments contained in it; and mentioned, with
some contempt, persons who could be influenced by such weak
reasoning. This was interpreted as a reflection on the new converts,
and particularly on the king himself; and a mandate was
issued to the Bishop of London, commanding that the obnoxious
preacher should be suspended. The issue of this matter has been
noticed in the notes on "Absalom and Achitophel," Vol. IX. p. 302.</p>

</div>

<p>Dryden here triumphs in the conquest he pretends to have gained
over Stillingfleet. In the beginning of the controversy, the
Dean of St Paul's had spoken dubiously of the authenticity of the
paper ascribed to the Duchess. In his Vindication, he fully admitted
that point, and insisted only upon the weakness of the reasons
which she alleged for her conversion. This Dryden compares
to a defeated vessel, bearing away under the smoke of her last
broadside.</p>

<p>The person, whom he states to have counselled Stillingfleet, is
probably Burnet; and the score which he paid, is the severe description
given of him under the character of the Buzzard. Dryden
always seems to have viewed the Answer to the Royal Papers
as the work of more than one hand. In his "Defence," he affirms,
that the answerer's "name is Legion; but though the body
be possessed with many evil spirits, it is but one of them that talks."
In the introduction to the "Hind and Panther," he says, he is informed
both of the "author and supervisors of this pamphlet." He
conjectured, as was probably the truth, that a controversy of such
importance, and which required to be managed with such peculiar
delicacy, was not entrusted to a single individual. Besides
Burnet, it is probable that Tillotson, Tennison, and Patrick, all
of whom mingled in the polemical disputes of that period, were
consulted by Stillingfleet on this important occasion.</p>

<p>The general application of the fable of the Swallows to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
short gleam of Catholic prosperity during the reign of James II.
is sufficiently manifest. But it is probable, that a more close and
intimate allusion was intended to an event which took place in
1686, when the whole nation was in confusion at the measures of
King James, so that the alarm had extended even to the Catholics,
who were the objects of his favour. We are told, there was a
general meeting of the leading Roman Catholics at the Savoy, to
consult how this favourable crisis might be most improved to the
advantage of their cause. Father Petre had the chair; and at
the very opening of the debates, it appeared, that the majority
were more inclined to provide for their own security, than to
come to extremities with the Protestants. Notwithstanding the
King's zeal, power, and success, they were afraid to push the experiment
any farther. The people were already alarmed, the
soldiers could not be depended upon, the very courtiers melted
out of their grasp. All depended on a single life, which was already
on the decline; and if that life should last yet a few years
longer, and continue as hitherto devoted to their interest and service,
they foresaw innumerable difficulties in their way, and anticipated
disappointments without end. Upon these considerations,
therefore, some were for a petition to the king, that he would only
so far interpose in their favour, that their estates might be secured
to them by act of parliament, with exemption from all employments,
and liberty to worship God in their own way, in their
own houses. Others were for obtaining the king's leave to sell
their estates, and transport themselves and their effects to France.
All but Father Petre were for a compromise of some sort or
other; but he disdained whatever had a tendency to moderation,
and was for making the most of the voyage while the sea was
smooth, and the wind prosperous. All these several opinions, we
are farther told, were laid before the king, who was pleased to answer,
"That before their desires were made known to him, he had
provided a sure retreat and sanctuary for them in Ireland, in case
all those endeavours which he was making for their security in
England should be blasted, and which as yet gave him no reason
to despair."<a name="FNanchor_272_273" id="FNanchor_272_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_273" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>It will hardly, I think, be disputed, that the fable of the Swallows
about to cross the seas refers to this consultation of the Catholics;
and it is a strong instance of Dryden's prejudice against
priests of all persuasions, that, in the character of the Martin,
who persuaded the Swallows to postpone the flight, he decidedly
appears to have designed Petre, the king's confessor and prime adviser
in state matters, both spiritual and temporal. The name of
Martin may contain an allusion to the parish of St Martin's, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
which Whitehall, and the royal chapel, are situated. But should
this be thought fanciful, it is certain, that the portrait of this vain,
presumptuous, ambitious, bigotted Jesuit, who was in keen pursuit
of a cardinal's cap, is exactly that of the Martin:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A church begot, and church believing bird,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of little body, but of lofty mind,</div>

</div>

<p>Two marked circumstances of resemblance conclude the inuendo,&mdash;his
noble birth, and superficial learning;</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be doubted, whether the reverend father was highly pleased
with this sarcastic description, or whether he admitted readily
the apology, that the poet, speaking in the character of the heretical
church, was obliged to use Protestant colouring.</p>

<p>The close correspondence of the fable with the real events may
be farther traced, and admit of yet more minute illustration:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The Raven, from the withered oak,</div>
  <div class="i0">Left of their lodging,&mdash;&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>may be conjectured to mean Tennison, within whose parish Whitehall
was situated, and who stood in the front of battle during all
the Roman Catholic controversy. As Petre is the Martin who
persuaded the Catholics not to leave the kingdom, his preparations
for maintaining their ground there are also noticed:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">He ordered all things with a busy care,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cells and refectories did prepare,</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This alludes to the numerous schools and religious establishments
which the Jesuits prepared to establish throughout England.<a name="FNanchor_274_275" id="FNanchor_274_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_275" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
The chapel which housed them is obviously the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
chapel, where the priests were privileged to exercise their functions
even during the subsistence of the penal laws. The transient
gleam of sunshine which invited the Swallows forth from their
retirement, is the Declaration of Indulgence, in consequence of
which the Catholics assumed the open and general exercise of
their religion. The Irish Catholics, with the sanguine Talbot at
their head, may be the first who hailed the imaginary return of
spring: they are painted as</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Swifts, the giants of the Swallow kind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Large limbed, stout hearted, but of stupid mind.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I cannot help thinking, that our author, still speaking in the
character of the English church, describes himself as the "foolish

the Swallow's delusion. Perhaps he intended to mitigate
the scornful description of Petre, by talking of himself also as
a Protestant would have talked of him. The foreign priests and

are pointed out by the "foreign fowl," who came in flocks,</p>

<p>The fable concludes in a prophetic strain, by indicating the calamities
which were likely to overwhelm the Catholics, as soon as
the death of James, or any similar event, should end their temporary
prosperity. It is well known, how exactly the event corresponded
to the prophecy; even the circumstance of the rabble
rising upon the Catholic priests was most literally verified. In
most of the sea-port towns, they watched the coasts to prevent
their escape; and when King James was taken at Feversham, the
fishermen, by whom he was seized, were employed in what they
called by the cant phrase of "priest-codding," that is, lying in
wait for the fugitive priests.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the fable naturally introduces a discussion
of the penal laws, which unquestionably were extremely severe
towards Catholics. By the fourteenth of Queen Elizabeth, it was
enacted, that whoever, by bulls of the pope, should reconcile
any one to Rome, should, together with the person reconciled,
be guilty of high treason; that those, who relieved such reconcilers,
should be liable in the penalties of a <em>premunire</em>, and those
who concealed them in misprision of treason. A still more severe
law passed in the twenty-eighth of the same queen, upon discovery
of Parry's conspiracy against her life, to which he had been
stirred up by a book of Allen, or Parsons the Jesuit, written for the
express purpose. It was thereby enacted, that all Jesuits and Popish
priests should depart the kingdom within forty days; and
that those who should afterwards return into the kingdom, should
be guilty of high treason; and all who relieved and maintained
them, of felony. There were other enactments of a similar nature
made upon the discovery of the gun-powder plot. Samuel
Johnson (I mean the divine) gives an odd justification of these
laws, saying, that the priests are hanged, not as priests, but as
traitors. But, as their being priests was the sole reason for their
being held traitors, it does not appear, that the Protestant divine
can avail himself of this distinction.</p>

<p>The fanatic author is John White, commonly called Century
White. He was born in Pembrokeshire in 1590, was educated
for the bar, and made a considerable figure in his profession. As
he was a rigid puritan, he was chosen one of the trustees which
that sect appointed to purchase impropriations to be bestowed upon
fanatic preachers. This design was checked by Archbishop
Laud; and White, among others, received a severe censure in the
Star-Chamber. In the Long Parliament, White was member for
Southwark, and distinguished himself by his vindictive severity
against the bishops and Episcopal clergy, saying openly in a committee,
he hoped to live to see the day, when there should be neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
bishop nor cathedral priest in England. He was very active
in the ejectment of the clergy, by which upwards of eight thousand
churchmen are said to have lost their cures in the course of four
or five years. In order to encourage and justify these violent
measures, he published his famous treatise, entitled, "The First
Century of Scandalous Malignant Priests, made and admitted into
benefices by the Prelates, London, 1643;" a tract which contains,
as may be inferred from its name, an hundred instances of
unworthiness, which had been either proved to have existed among
the clergy of the church of England, or had been invented to throw
a slander upon them. When this satire was shown to Charles I.,
it was proposed to answer it by a similar exposition of the scandalous
part of the puritanical teachers; but that monarch would
not consent to give countenance to a warfare in which neither
party could gain, and religion was sure to be a loser between them.
Similar considerations are said to have prevented White himself
from publishing "A Second Century," in continuation of his
work. He wrote another tract, entitled, "The Looking Glass;"
in which he attempted to prove, that the sin against the Holy
Ghost was the bearing arms for the king in the civil war. His
own party bestow on White a high character for religion and virtue;
but the cavaliers alleged, that although he had two wives of
his own, a large proportion of matrimony, he did not forbear to visit
three belonging to his neighbours in the White Friars. He died in
January 1644, and is said, in his last illness, to have bitterly lamented
the active share which he had taken in ejecting so many
guiltless ministers, and their families. This, however, may be a fiction
of the royalists; for the death-bed repentance of an enemy is
amongst the most common forgeries of party. White's body was
attended to the grave by most of the members of Parliament, and
the following distich inscribed on his tomb:</p>

<p>When James II. ascended the throne, deceived by the general
attachment of the church of England for his person, and the
little jealousy which they seemed to entertain of his religion,
he conceived there would be no great difficulty in procuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a reconciliation between the national church and that of Rome.
With this view he made a favourable declaration of his intentions
to maintain the church of England as by law established, and certainly
expected, that, in return, they would consent to the repeal
of the test act and penal laws;<a name="FNanchor_275_276" id="FNanchor_275_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_276" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and this, it was conceived,
might pave the way for uniting the churches. An extraordinary
pamphlet, already quoted, recommends such an union, founded
upon the mutual attachment of both communions to King James,
upon their success in resisting the Bill of Exclusion, and their common
hatred of the dissenters. "This very stone, which was once rejected
by the architects, is now become the chief stone in the corner.
We may truly see in it the hand of God, and look upon it
with admiration; and may expect, if fears and jealousies hinder
not, the greatest blessings we can wish for. An union betwixt
these two walls, which have been thus long separated, and now in
a fair way to be united and linked together by this corner stone;
after which, how glorious a structure may we hope for on such
foundations!" A plan is therefore laid down, containing the following
heads, of which it may be observed, that the very first is the
abrogation of these penal laws, which Dryden states to be the principal
bar between the alliance of the Hind and the Panther.</p>

<p>"First, that it may be provided, That those who are known to
be faithful friends to the king and kingdom's good, may equally
with us enjoy those favours and blessings we may hope for under so
great and so just a king, without being liable to the sanguinary
penal laws, for holding opinions noways inconsistent with loyalty,
and the peace and quiet of the nation; and that they may
not be obliged, by oaths and tests, either to renounce their religion,
which they know they cannot do without sacrilege, or else
to put themselves out of capacity of serving their king and country.</p>

<p>"Secondly, That, for healing our differences, it be appointed,
that neither side, in their sermons, touch upon matters of controversy
with animating reflections; but that those discourses may
wholly tend to peace and piety, religion and sound morality; and
that, in all public catechisms, the solid grounds and principles of
religion may be solely explicated and established, all reflecting
animosities being laid aside.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, That some learned, devout, and sober persons, may
be made choice of on both sides, who may truly state matters of
controversy betwixt us; to the end, each one may know others
pretensions, and the tenets they cannot abandon, without breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the chain of apostolic faith; which, if it be done, we shall, it may
be, find that to be true, which the Papists often tell us, that the
difference betwixt them and us is not so great as many make it;
nor their tenets so pernicious, but if we saw them naked, we should,
if not embrace them as truths, yet not condemn them as errors,
much less as pernicious doctrines. Yet if, notwithstanding
all this, we cannot perfectly agree in some points, let us, however,
endeavour to live together in the bonds of love and charity, as
becomes good Christians and loyal subjects, and join together to
oppugn those known maxims, and pernicious errors, which destroy
the essence of religion, loyalty, and good government."&mdash;<cite>Remonstrance,

<p>The Test-act was passed in the year 1678, while the popish
plot was in its vigour, and the Earl of Shaftesbury was urging
every point against the Catholics, with his eyes uniformly fixed
upon the Bill of Exclusion as his crowning measure. It imposed
on all who should sit in parliament, a declaration of their abhorrence
of the doctrine of transubstantiation. The Duke of York,
with tears in his eyes, moved for a proviso to exempt himself,
protesting, that he cast himself upon the House in the greatest
concern he could have in the world; and that whatever his religion
might be, it should only be a private thing between God and
his own soul. Notwithstanding this pathetic appeal, he carried
his point but by two votes. With seven other peers he protested
against the bill. Dryden therefore, and probably with great justice,
represents this test as a part of his machinations against the
Duke of York, whose party was at that time, and afterwards,
warmly espoused by the church of England. But though the Test-act
was devised by a statesman whom they hated, and carried by a
party whom they had opposed, the high-church clergy were not the
less unwilling to part with it when they found the advantages
which it gave them against the Papists in King James's reign.
Hence they were loaded with the following reproaches: "My
business is to set forth, in its own colours, the extraordinary loyalty
of those men, who obstinately maintain a test contrived by the
faction to usher in the Bill of Exclusion: And it is much admired,
even by some of her own children, that the grave and matron-like
church of England, which values herself so much for her antiquity,
should be over-fond of a new point of faith, lately broached by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
famous act of an infallible parliament, convened at Westminster,
and guided by the holy spirit of Shaftesbury. But I doubt there
are some parliaments in the world which will not so easily admit
this new article into their creed, though the church of England labours
so much to maintain it as a special evidence of her singular
loyalty."&mdash;<cite>New Test of the Church of England's Loyalty.</cite></p>

<p>This passage regards the situation of the Roman Catholic peers.
Notwithstanding their religion, they had been allowed to retain
their seats and votes in the House of Lords. So jealous were they,
(as was but natural,) of this privilege, that, in 1675, when Danby
proposed a test oath upon all holding state employments and benefices,
the object of which was to acknowledge the doctrine of
non-resistance, and disown all attempts at an alteration of government,
the Roman Catholic peers, to the number of twenty, who
had hitherto always voted with the crown, united, on this occasion,
with the opposition, and occasioned the loss of the bill. This
North imputes to the art of Shaftesbury, who dinned into their
ears, "that this test (by mentioning the maintenance of the Protestant
religion, though that of the royal authority was chiefly
proposed) tended to deprive them of their right of voting, which
was a birth-right so sacrosanct and radically inherent in the peerage,
as not to be temerated on any account whatsoever." When the
earl had heated the Catholic lords with this suggestion, he secured
them to the opposition, by proposing, and carrying through, an order
of the House, that no bill should be received, tending to deprive
any of the peerage of their right. But when the Test-act of 1678
was moved, which had, for its direct purpose, that exclusion which
that of 1675 was supposed only to convey by implication, Shaftesbury
laughed at the order which he himself had proposed, saying,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">leges posteriores priores abrogant</i>. And by this test, which required
the renunciation of their religion as idolatrous, the Catholic peerage
were effectually, and for ever, excluded from their seats in the
House of Lords. Dryden intimates, in the following lines, that
this test applied to the Papists alone, and complains heavily of this
odious distinction, betwixt them and other non-conformists.</p>

<p>James II. and the established church set out on the highest
terms of good humour with each other. This, as the king afterwards
assured the dissenters, was owing to the professions made to
him by some of the churchmen, whom he named, who had promised
favour to the Catholics, provided he would abandon all idea
of general toleration, and leave them their ancient authority over
the fanatics. Moved, as he said, by these promises, the Declaration
in council, issued upon his accession, had this remarkable
clause: "I know the principles of the church of England are for
monarchy, and the members of it have shewn themselves good and
loyal subjects, therefore I shall always take care to defend and
support it." This explicit declaration gave the greatest satisfaction
to the kingdom in general, and particularly to the clergy.
"All the pulpits of England," says Burnet, "were full of it, and
of thanksgivings for it. It was magnified as a security far greater
than any that laws could give. The common phrase was, <em>We have
now the word of a king, and a word never yet broken</em>. This general
feeling of gratitude led to a set of addresses, full of the most
extravagant expressions of loyalty and fidelity to so gracious a sovereign.
The churchmen led the way in these expressions of zeal;
and the university of Oxford, in particular, promised to obey the
king without limitations or restrictions." The king's promise was
reckoned so solemn and inviolable, that those addresses were censured
as guilty at least of ill-breeding, who mentioned in their papers
the "religion <em>established by law</em>;" since that expression implied
an obligation on the king to maintain it, independently of his
royal grace and favour. But the scene speedily changed, as the
king's intentions began to disclose themselves. Then, as a Catholic
pamphleteer expresses himself, "My loyal gentlemen were so
far out of the right bias, that, in lieu of taking off the tests and penal
laws, which all people expected from them in point of gratitude
and good manners, they made a solemn address to his majesty,
that none be employed who were not capacitated by the said
laws and tests to bear offices civil and military."<a name="FNanchor_276_277" id="FNanchor_276_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_277" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>If James, had viewed with attention the incidents of the former
reign, he might have recollected, that, however devoted the clergy
had then shown themselves to the crown, his brother's attempt at
his present measure of a general indulgence had at once alarmed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
whole church. This sensibility, when the interest of the church
is concerned, is severely contrasted with the general indifference
to the cause of freedom, into which they relapsed when the indulgence
was recalled, in a party pamphlet of the year 1680-1.
"You may easily call to mind, a late instance of the humanity
and conscience of this race of men here in England: For when
his majesty, not long since, attempted to follow his own inclinations,
and emitted a declaration of indulgence to tender consciences,
the whole <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">posse cleri</i> seemed to be raised against him: Every
reader and Gibeonite of the church could then talk as saucily of
their king, as they do now of the late honourable Parliament;
nay, they began to stand upon their terms, and delivered it out as
orthodox doctrine, that the king was to act according to law, and,
therefore, could not suspend a penal statute; that the subjects'
obedience was a legal obedience; and, therefore, if the king commanded
any thing contrary to law, the subject was not bound to
obey; with so many other honest positions, that men wondered in
God how such knaves should come by them. But wherefore was
all this wrath, and all this doctrine? merely because his majesty
was pleased for a time to remove the sore backs of dissenters from
under the ecclesiastical lash; the bloody exercise of which is never
denied to holy church, but the magistrate is immediately assaulted
with the noise and clamour of Demetrius and his craftsmen.</p>

<p>"But now, the tables being turned, the same mercenary tongues
are again all Sibthorp, and all Manwaring; not a bit of law, or
conscience either, is now to be had for love or money; not any limits
to be put to the king's commands, or our obedience. It is a
gospel truth with these men, that all which we have is the king's;
and if he should command our estates, our wives and children,
yea, and our religion too, we ought to resign them up, submit,
and be silent."&mdash;<cite>The Freeholders' Choice, or, A Letter of Advice

<p>The first expression in these lines seems to have been a favourite
with Dryden. In the Introduction to the Translation of Juvenal,
he makes it his glory, "that, being naturally vindicative, he
had suffered in silence, and <em>possessed his soul in quiet</em>."</p>

<p>The arguments used by the Panther in this passage seem to
have more weight than her antagonist allows them. It was surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
reasonable, that the church of England should rest upon her penal
statutes and test act, as the sole mode of preventing the encroachments
of her rival during a Catholic reign, and at the same time
that she should look forward with pleasure to a future period, when
such severe enactments might be no longer necessary for her safety;
a time, of which it has been our good fortune to witness the
arrival.</p>

<p>The argument of the Panther, in this speech, is, with the simile
of the inundation, literally versified from an answer to Penn's
pamphlet. "The penal laws cannot prejudice the Papists in this
king's reign, seeing he can connive at the non-execution of them,
and the repeal of them now cannot benefit the Papists when he is
gone; because, if they do not behave themselves modestly, we can
either re-establish them, or enact others, which they will be as
little fond of. But their abrogation at this time would infallibly
prejudice us, and would prove to be the pulling up of the sluices,
and the throwing down the dikes, which stem the deluge that is
breaking in upon us, and which hinder the threatening waves from
overflowing us." <em>Some reflections on a discourse, entitled</em>, "Good

<p>This conveys a perilous insinuation, which perhaps it would, at
the time, have been prudent to suppress; since it goes the length
of preparing a justification of the resumption of the power, authority,

<p>Burnet, in the "History of his Own Times," gives the following
account of the relief which James, either from inclination or policy,
extended to the French Protestants, who were exiled by the
recal of the edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>"But now the session of Parliament drew on, and there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
great expectation of the issue of it. For some weeks before it
met, there was such a number of refugees coming over every day,
who set about a most dismal recital of the persecution in France;
and that in so many instances that were crying and odious, that,
though all endeavours were used to lessen the clamour this had
raised, yet the king did not stick openly to condemn it as both unchristian
and unpolitic. He took pains to clear the Jesuits of it,
and laid the blame of it chiefly on the king, on Madame de Maintenon,
and the Archbishop of Paris. He spoke often of it with
such vehemence, that there seemed to be an affectation in it. He
did more: He was very kind to the refugees; he was liberal to
many of them; he ordered a brief for a charitable collection over
the nation for them all; upon which great sums were sent in.
They were deposited in good hands, and well distributed. The
king also ordered them to be denizen'd, without paying fees, and
gave them great immunities. So that, in all, there came over, first
and last, between forty and fifty thousand of that nation. There
was such real argument of the cruel and persecuting spirit of popery,
wheresoever it prevailed, that few could resist this conviction;
so that all men confessed, that the French persecution came very
seasonably to awaken the nation, and open men's eyes in so critical
a conjunction; for upon this session of Parliament all did depend."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Burnet</span>,

<p>These, and the following lines, contain a character of James II.
most exquisitely drawn, though, it must be owned, with a flattering
pencil. Bravery, economy, integrity, are the ingredients which
Dryden has mixed for his colours. Without attempting a character
of this unfortunate monarch, we may say a few words on each
of the attributes ascribed to him. Bravery he unquestionably
possessed; but it was of that ordinary kind, which, though unshaken
by mere personal danger, is unable to sustain its possessor
in great and embarrassing political emergencies. The economy
of James, being one great engine by which he hoped to carry
on his projects, was so rigid as sometimes to border upon
avarice. His upright integrity, the virtue upon which he chiefly
prided himself, and which was the usual theme of courtly panegyric,
frequently deviated into obstinacy. When he had once resolved
upon a measure, he often announced his resolution with imprudence,
and almost always pressed it with an open disregard of
consequences. No fault can be more fatal to an English king;
because the stream of popular opinion, which would subside if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
unopposed, becomes irresistible when the obstinacy of a monarch
persists in attempting to stem it.</p>

<p>The virulent and abusive character which our author here draws
of the clergy, and particularly those of the metropolis, differs so
much from his description of the church of England, in the person
of the Panther, that we may conclude it was written after the publishing
of the Declaration of Indulgence, when the king had decidedly
turned his favour from the established church. Their
quarrel was now irreconcileable, and at immediate issue; and
Dryden therefore changes the tone of conciliation, with which he
had hitherto addressed the heretic church, into that of bitter and
unrelenting satire. Dryden calls them doves, in order to pave the
way for terming them, as he does a little below, "birds of Venus;"
as disowning the doctrine of celibacy. The popular opinion, that
a dove has no gall, is well known. In Scotland, this is averred to
be owing to the dove which Noah dismissed from the ark having
flown so long, that his gall broke; since which occurrence, none
of the species have had any.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic pamphlets of the time are filled with complaints,
that their principles were misrepresented by the Protestant
divines; and that king-killing tenets, and others of a pernicious
or absurd nature, were unjustly ascribed to them. A tract, which
is written on purpose to explain their real doctrine, says, "Is it
not strange and severe, that principles, and those pretended of
faith too, should be imposed upon men which they themselves renounce
and detest? If the Turks' Alcoran should, in like manner,
be urged upon us, and we hanged up for Mahometans, all we
could do or say, in such a case, would be, to die patiently, with
protestations of our own innocence. And this is the posture of
our condition; we abhor, we renounce, we abominate, such principles;
we protest against them, and seal our protestations with
our dying breath. What shall we say, what can we do more?
To accuse men as guilty in matters of faith, which they never owned,
is the same thing as to condemn them for matters of fact which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
they never did."<a name="FNanchor_277_278" id="FNanchor_277_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_278" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Another author, speaking in the assumed character
of the established church, says, that the Catholic controvertists
have often told us, that "we behave ourselves like persons
diffident of our cause, decline disputes on equal terms, and either
misrepresent their tenets, as appears manifestly in their doctrines
of justification and merit, satisfaction and indulgences; or else
play the buffoons, joking, scoffing, and relating stories, which, if
true, would not touch religion."&mdash;<cite>A Remonstrance, by way of Address</cite>,

<p>Gilbert Burnet, well known as an historian, was born of a good
family in Scotland, in 1643. He went through his studies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
success; and, being ordained by the Bishop of Edinburgh, obtained
the living of Salton, in East Lothian, in 1665. While in
this living, he drew up a memorial of the abuses of the Scotch
bishops, and was instrumental in procuring the induction of Presbyterian
divines into vacant churches; a step which he afterwards
condemned as imprudent.<a name="FNanchor_279_280" id="FNanchor_279_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_280" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> To measures so unfavourable for Episcopacy,
Dryden seems to allude, in these lines:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="small90">I know he hates the Pigeon-house and Farm,</span></div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="small90">And more, in time of war, has done us harm;</span></div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="small90">But all his hate on trivial points depends,</span></div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="small90">Give up our forms, and we shall soon be friends.</span></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Burnet's opinion, or rather indifference, concerning forms, may
be guessed at, from the applause with which he quotes a saying of
Dr Henry More; "None of them are bad enough to make men
bad, and I am sure none of them are good enough to make men
good." He was next created professor of divinity at Glasgow;
but as his active temper led him to mingle much in political life,
he speedily distinguished himself rather as a politician than a theologian.
In 1672 he was made one of the king's chaplains, and
was in high favour both with Charles and his brother. He enjoyed
much of the countenance of the Duke of Lauderdale; but a
quarrel taking place between them, the duke represented Burnet's
conduct in such terms, that he was deprived of his chaplainry, and
forced to resign his professor's chair, and abandon Scotland. He
had an opportunity of revenging himself upon Lauderdale, as will
be noticed in a subsequent note. During the time of the Popish
plot, he again received a portion of the royal countenance. He
was then preacher at the Rolls Chapel, under the patronage of Sir
Harbottle Grimstone, master of the rolls, as also lecturer at St
Clement's, and enjoyed a high degree of public consideration. Having,
as he conceived, a fit opportunity to awaken the conscience
of Charles, he ventured upon sending him a letter, where he
treated his personal vices, and the faults of his government, with
great severity,<a name="FNanchor_280_281" id="FNanchor_280_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_281" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and by which he forfeited his favour for ever.
This freedom, with his low-church tenets, gave also offence to
the Duke of York, who was, moreover, offended with him for
some interference in the affair of the Exclusion, in which, if he
did not go all the length of Shaftesbury, he recommended the
appointment of a prince-regent; a measure scarcely more palatable
to the successor. At length, his regard for Lord Russell,
and the share which he took in penning, or circulating, his dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
declaration, drew upon him the full resentment of both brothers.
To this, a whimsical accident, in the choice of a text for the day
of the gun-powder plot, happened to contribute. The preacher
<em>chanced</em> (for we must believe what he assures us, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex verbo sacerdotis</i>)
to pitch on these words: "Save me from the <em>lion's</em> mouth;
thou hast delivered me from the horns of the <em>unicorn</em>." This was
interpreted as referring to the supporters of the royal arms; and
Burnet was discharged, by the king's command, both from lecturing
at St Clement's, and preaching at the Rolls Chapel. After this final
breach with the court he went abroad, and, having travelled through
France and Italy, settled in Holland at the court of the Prince of
Orange. Here he did not fail, with that ready insinuation which
seems to have distinguished him, to make himself of consequence
to the prince, and especially to the princess, afterwards Queen
Mary. From this place of refuge he sent forth several papers,
in single sheets, relating to the controversy in England; and the
clergy, who had formerly looked upon him with some suspicion,
began now to treat with great attention and respect a person
so capable of serving their cause. He was consulted upon
every emergency; which confidence was no doubt owing partly to
his situation near the person of the Prince of Orange, the Protestant
heir of the crown. He stood forward as the champion of
the church of England, in the controversy with Parker concerning
the Test.<a name="FNanchor_281_282" id="FNanchor_281_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_282" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> In the "History of his Own Times," the bishop talks
with complacency of the sway which circumstances had given him
among the clergy, and of the important matters which fell under
his management; for, by express command of the Prince of
Orange, he was admitted into all the secrets of the English intrigues.
These insinuations of Burnet's importance, although they
afterwards drew the ridicule of Pope, and the Tory wits of Queen
Anne's reign, may, from the very satire of Dryden, be proved to
have been well founded. This acquired importance of Burnet is
the alliance between the Pigeon-house and Buzzard, which Dryden
reprobates, believing, or wishing to make others believe, that
Burnet held opinions unfavourable to Episcopacy. James considered
this divine as so formidable an enemy, that he wrote two
very severe letters to his daughter against him, and proceeded so
far as to insist that he should be forbidden the court; a circumstance
which did not prevent his privately receiving a double degree
of countenance. A prosecution for high treason was next
commenced against Burnet, and a demand was made that he
should be delivered up; which the States evaded, by declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that he was naturalized, by marrying a Dutch lady. The court
of England were then supposed to have formed some plan, as they
had attempted in the case of Peyton, of seizing, or perhaps assassinating
him, and a reward of L. 3000 was offered for the service.
Burnet, however, confident in the protection of the prince and
states of Holland, answered, replied, and retorted, and carried on
almost an immediate controversy with his sovereign, dated from the
court of his son-in-law. This active politician had a very important
share in the Revolution, and reaped his reward, by being
advanced to the see of Salisbury. He died on the 17th of March,
1714-15.</p>

<p>His writings, theological, political, and polemical, are very numerous;
but he is most remarkable as an historian. The "History
of the Reformation," but more especially that of "His Own
Times," raises him to a high rank among our English historians.</p>

<p>It must be owned, that, with all Bishop Burnet's good qualities,
there are particulars in his history which give colour for this
accusation. His opinions were often hastily adopted, and of course
sometimes awkwardly retracted, and his patrons were frequently
changed. Thus, he vindicated the legality of divorce for barrenness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on the part of the wife, and even that of polygamy, in his
resolution of two important cases of conscience. These were intended
to pave the way for Charles divorcing his barren wife Catherine,
or marrying another; and so raising a family of his own
to succeed him, instead of the Duke of York. These opinions he
formally retracted. Notwithstanding his zeal for liberty, his first
work is said by Swift to have been written in defense of arbitrary
power. Above all, his great intimacy with the Dukes of Hamilton
and Lauderdale, the King and the Duke of York, the Pope
and the Prince of Orange; in short, his having the address to attach
himself for a time to almost every leading character, whom
he had an opportunity of approaching, gives us room to suspect,
that if Burnet did not change his opinions, he had at least the art
of disguising such as could not be accommodated to those of his
immediate patron. When the king demanded that Burnet should
be delivered up by the States, he threatened, in return, to justify
himself, by giving an account of the share he had in affairs for
twenty years past; in which he intimated, he might be driven to
mention some particulars, which would displease the king. This
threat, as he had enjoyed a considerable share of his confidence when
Duke of York, may seem, in some degree, to justify Dryden's heavy
charge against him, of availing himself of past confidence to
criminate former patrons. It is remarkable, also, that even while
he was in the secret of all the intrigues of the Revolution, and
must have considered it as a near attempt, he continued to assert
the doctrine of passive obedience; and in his letter to
Middleton, in vindication of his conduct against the charge of
high treason, there is an affectation of excessive loyalty to the
reigning monarch. Against these instances of dissimulation, forced
upon him perhaps by circumstances, but still unworthy and
degrading, we may oppose many others, in which, when his
principles and interest were placed at issue, he refused to serve
the latter at the expence of the former.</p>

<p>This applies to the sketches of characters introduced by Burnet
in his controversial tracts. But long after the period when
Dryden wrote, the publication of the History of his Own Times
confirmed, to a certain extent, the censure here imposed. It is a
general and just objection to the bishop's historical characters,
that they are drawn up with too much severity, and that the keenness
of party has induced him, in many cases, to impose upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
reader a caricature for a resemblance. Yet there appears to have
been perfect good faith upon his own part; so that we may safely
acquit him of any intention to exaggerate the faults, or conceal
the virtues, of his political enemies. He seems himself to have
been conscious of a disposition to look upon the dark side of humanity.
"I find," says he, "that the long experience I have had
of the baseness, the malice, and the falsehood of mankind, has inclined
me to be apt to think generally the worst of men, and of
parties." Burnet therefore candidly puts the reader upon his
guard against this predominant foible, and expressly warns him to
receive what he advances with some grains of allowance.</p>

<p>But whatever was Burnet's private opinion of the conduct of
others, and however much he might be misled by prejudice in
drawing their characters, it should not be forgotten, that, in the
moments of triumph which succeeded the Revolution, he not only
resisted every temptation to revenge for personal injuries, but
employed all his influence to recommend mild and conciliating
conduct to the successful party. Some, who had suffered under
the severity of James's reign, were extremely indignant at what
seemed to them to argue too much feeling for their discomfited
adversaries, and too little sympathy with their own past distresses.
Samuel Johnson, in particular, reprobates the Scottish bishop's exhortations
to forgiveness and forgetfulness of injuries. "And,
besides, we have Scotch doctors, to teach us the art of forgetfulness.
Pray you have <em>gude</em> memories, <em>gude</em> memories; do not remember
bad things, (meaning the murders and oppressions of the
last reigns,) but keep your memories for <em>gude</em> things, have <em>gude</em> memories."
To this mimicry of the bishop's dialect, in which, however,
he seems to have conveyed most wholesome and sound council,
Johnson adds, that, during the sitting of King William's first parliament,
while his complaints were before them, the bishop sent to him
his advice, "Not to name persons." "I gave, says he, an English
reply to that message; 'Let him mind his business, I will mind
mine.' His bookseller, Mr Chiswell, by whom I had the message,
seemed loth to carry him that blunt answer. Oh! said I, he has
got the title of a Lord lately, I must qualify my answer: 'Let him
<em>please</em> to mind his own business, I will mind mine."&mdash;This was
very natural for one smarting under sufferings, who complains,
that "while a certain traveller," meaning Burnet, "was making his
court to the cardinals at Rome, he got such an almanack in his
bones, (from scourging,) as to incapacitate him from learning this
Scotch trick of a <em>gude</em> memory."<a name="FNanchor_283_284" id="FNanchor_283_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_284" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But it is the very character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of moderate councils to be disgusting to those who have been
hurried beyond their patience by oppression; and Johnson's testimony,
though given with a contrary view, is highly honourable
to the bishop's prudence.</p>

<p>In 1675, the House of Commons being resolved to assail the
Duke of Lauderdale, and knowing that Burnet, in whom he had
once reposed much confidence, could bear witness to some dangerous
designs and expressions, appointed the doctor to attend and
be examined. His own account of this delicate transaction is as
follows:</p>

<p>"In April 1675, a session of parliament was held, as preparatory
to one that was designed next winter, in which money was
to be asked; but none was now asked, it being only called to heal
all breaches, and to beget a good understanding between the king
and his people. The House of Commons fell upon Duke Lauderdale;
and those who knew what had passed between him and me,
moved, that I should be examined before a committee. I was
brought before them. I told them how I had been commanded
out of town; but though that was illegal, yet since it had been
let fall, it was not insisted on. I was next examined concerning
his design of arming the Irish Papists. I said, I, as well as others,
had heard him say, he wished the Presbyterians in Scotland would
rebel, that he might bring over the Irish Papists to cut their
throats. I was next examined concerning the design of bringing
a Scottish army into England. I desired to be excused, as to
what had passed in private discourse; to which I thought I was not
bound to answer, unless it were high treason. They pressed me
long, and I would give them no other answer; so they all concluded,
that I knew great matters; and reported this specially to
the House. Upon that I was sent for, and brought before the
House. I stood upon it as I had done at the committee, that I
was not bound to answer; that nothing had passed that was high
treason; and as to all other things, I did not think myself bound
to discover them. I said farther, I knew the Duke Lauderdale
was apt to say things in a heat, which he did not intend to do;
and, since he had used myself so ill, I thought myself the more
obliged not to say any thing that looked like revenge, for what I
had met with from him. I was brought four times to the bar;
at last I was told, the House thought they had a right to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
into every thing that concerned the safety of the nation, as well as
into matters of treason; and they looked on me as bound to satisfy
them, otherwise they would make me feel the weight of their
heavy displeasure, as one that concealed what they thought was
necessary to be known. Upon this I yielded, and gave an account
of the discourse formerly mentioned. They laid great weight on
this, and renewed their address against Duke Lauderdale.</p>

<p>"I was much blamed for what I had done. Some, to make it look
the worse, added, that I had been his chaplain, which was false;
and that I had been much obliged to him, though I had never received
any real obligation from him, but had done him great services,
for which I had been very unworthily requited: Yet the
thing had an ill appearance, as the disclosing of what had passed
in confidence; though I make it a great question, how far even
that ought to bind a man when the designs are very wicked, and
the person continued still in the same post and capacity of executing
them. I have told the matter as it was, and must leave myself
to the censure of the reader. My love to my country, and
my private friendship, carried me, perhaps, too far; especially
since I had declared much against clergymen's meddling in secular
affairs, and yet had run myself so deep in them."&mdash;<cite>History of
his Own Times</cite>, Vol. I. p. 375.</p>

<p>The discourse to which Burnet refers was of the following dangerous
tendency, and took place in September 1673.</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Duke.</i> If the king should need an army from Scotland, to
tame those in England, might the Scots be depended upon?</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Burnet.</i> Certainly not. The commons in the southern parts
are all Presbyterians. The nobility thought they had been ill
used, were generally discontented, and only waited for an opportunity
to show it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Duke.</i> I am of another mind. The hope of the spoil of England
will bring them all in.</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Burnet.</i> The king is ruined if he trusts to that; for even indifferent
persons, who might otherwise have been ready enough to
push their fortunes without any anxious enquiries into the grounds
they went upon, will not now trust the king, since he has so lately
said, he would stick to his declaration,<a name="FNanchor_284_285" id="FNanchor_284_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_285" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and yet has so soon
given it up.</p>

<p>"Duke. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hinc illæ lacrymæ.</i> The king was forsaken in that
matter, and none sticks to him but Lord Clifford and myself."&mdash;<cite>Ralph,
with the Authorities he quotes</cite>, Vol. I. p. 275.</p>

<p>James II. afterwards revived the plan of maintaining a Scottish
standing army, to bridle his English subjects.</p>

<p>To run a-muck, is a phrase derived from a practice of the Malays.
When one of this nation has lost his whole substance by gaming,
or sustained any other great and insupportable calamity, he
intoxicates himself with opium; and, having dishevelled his hair,
rushes into the streets, crying <em>Amocca</em>, or <em>Kill</em>, and stabbing

</div>

<p>Burnet may have been thus denominated, from having written
the following pamphlets, in the controversy respecting the Test,
against Parker, the apostate bishop of Oxford:</p>

<p>"An Enquiry into the Reasons for Abrogating the Test imposed
on all Members of Parliament, offered by Dr Samuel Parker,
Bishop of Oxford."</p>

<p>"A Second Part of the Enquiry into the Reasons offered by
Doctor Samuel Parker, bishop of Oxford, for Abrogating the
Test; or an Answer to his plea for Transubstantiation, and for
Acquitting the Church of Rome of Idolatry."</p>

<p>"A Continuation of the Second Part of the Enquiry into the
Reasons offered by Dr Samuel Parker, Bishop of Oxford, for
Abrogating the Test relating to the Idolatry of the Church of
Rome."</p>

<p>These two last pamphlets were afterwards thrown together in
one tract, entitled, "A Discourse concerning Transubstantiation
and Idolatry, being an Answer to the Bishop of Oxford's plea relating
to these two points."</p>

<p>Burnet himself admits, that his papers, in this controversy with
Parker, were written with an acrimony of style which nothing but
such a time and such a man could excuse. His papers were so
bitter, that nobody durst offer them to the bishop of Oxford, till
the king himself sent them to him, in hopes to stimulate him to an
answer.</p>

<p>Several of these pieces seem to have been published after "The
Hind and the Panther;" but it must have been generally known at
the time, that Burnet had placed himself in the front of this controversy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The passage particularly referred to in these lines occurs in a tract,
entitled, "Reasons against repealing the Act of Parliament, concerning
the Test," which is the first of six papers published by Dr
Burnet when in Holland, and reprinted at London in 1689. His
words are these:</p>

<p>"IX. I am told some think it very indecent to have a test for
our parliaments, in which the king's religion is accused of idolatry;
but if this reason is good in this particular, it will be full as
good against several of the articles of our church, and many of the
homilies. If the church and religion of this nation is so formed
by law, that the king's religion is declared over and over again to
be idolatrous, what help is there for it? It is no other than it was
when his majesty was crowned, and swore to maintain our laws.</p>

<p>"I hope none will be wanting in all possible respect to his sacred
person; and as we ought to be infinitely sorry to find him
engaged in a religion which we must believe idolatrous, so we are
far from the ill manners of reflecting on his person, or calling him
an idolater: for as every man that reports a lie, is not for that
to be called a liar; so that, though the ordering the intention,
and the prejudice of a mis-persuasion, are such abatements, that
we will not rashly take on us to call every man of the church of
Rome an idolater; yet, on the other hand, we can never lay down
our charge against the church of Rome as guilty of idolatry, unless
at the same time we part with our religion."</p>

<p>We cannot suppose that Burnet was insensible to the poignancy
of Dryden's satire; for, although he attempts to treat the poem
with contempt, in the defence of his "Reflections on Varillas' History,"
his coarse and virulent character of the poet plainly shows
his inward feelings. "I have been informed from England, that
a gentleman, who is known both for poetry and other things, had
spent three months in translating M. Varillas's History; but that,
as soon as my Reflections appeared, he discontinued his labour,
finding the credit of his author was gone. Now, if he thinks it
is recovered by his Answer, he will perhaps go on with his translation;
and this may be, for aught I know, as good an entertainment
for him as the conversation that he had set on between the
Hinds and Panthers, and all the rest of animals, for whom M.
Varillas may serve well enough for an author: and this history
and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind, that
it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem, become
likewise the translator of the worst history, that the age has
produced. If his grace and his wit improve both proportionably,
he will hardly find that he has gained much by the change he has
made, from having no religion to choose one of the worst. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
true, he had something to sink from, in matter of wit; but as for
his morals, it is scarce possible for him to grow a worse man than
he was. He has lately wreaked his malice on me for spoiling his
three months' labour; but in it he has done me all the honour
that any man can receive from him, which is to be railed at by
him. If I had ill-nature enough to prompt me to wish a very
bad wish for him, it should be, that he would go on and finish his
translation. By that it will appear, whether the English nation,
which is the most competent judge in this matter, has, upon the
seeing our debate, pronounced in M. Varillas's favour, or in mine.
It is true, Mr D. will suffer a little by it; but at least it will
serve to keep him in from other extravagancies; and if he gains
little honour by this work, yet he cannot lose so much by it, as
he has done by his last employment."</p>

<p>Part of the controversy which now raged, turned on the precise
meaning of the king's promise, to maintain the church of
England as by law established. The church party insisted, that
the Declaration of Indulgence was a breach of this promise, as it
suspended their legal safeguards, the test and penal laws. The
advocates for the toleration answered, that the promise was conditional,
and depended on the church consenting to the abrogation
of these laws. This was stated by Penn, in his "Good Advice;"
to which the following indignant answer is made by a
champion of the church, perhaps Burnet himself:</p>

<p>"And if there be no other way of giving the king an opportunity
of keeping his word with the church of England, in preserving
her, and maintaining our religion, but the repealing of the
penal and test laws, as he intimates unto us, (Good Advice, p. 50.)
we have not found the royal faith so sacred and inviolable in other
instances, as to rob ourselves of a legal defence and protection,
for to depend upon the precarious one of a base promise, which
his ghostly fathers, whensoever they find it convenient, will tell
him it was unlawful to make, and which he can have a dispensation
for the breaking of, at what time he pleaseth. Nor do we
remember, that when he pledged his faith unto us, in so many
promises, that the parting with our laws was declared to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
condition upon which he made, and undertook to perform them.
Neither can any have the confidence to allege it, without having
recourse to the Papal doctrine of mental reservation. Which
being one of the principles of that order, under whose conduct he
is, makes us justly afraid to rely upon his word without further
security. However, we do hereby see, with what little sincerity
Mr Penn writes; and what small regard he hath to his majesty's
honour, when he tells the church of England, that if she please,
and like the terms of giving up the penal and test laws against
Papists, that then the king will perform his word with her; (Good
Advice, p. 17.) but that otherwise, it is she who breaks with him,
and not he with her." (<em>Ibid.</em> p. 44.)</p>

<p>The declaration for liberty of conscience was a strange and incongruous,
as well as most impolitic performance. It set out with
declaring, that although the king heartily wished that all his subjects
were members of the Catholic church, (which they returned,
by heartily wishing that he were a Protestant,) yet he abhorred
all idea of constraining conscience; and therefore, <em>making no
doubt of the concurrence of Parliament</em>, declared, 1. That he
would protect and maintain the bishops, &amp;c. of the church of
England, as by law established, in the free exercise of their religion,
and quiet enjoyment of their possessions. 2. That all execution
of penal laws against non-conformists be suspended. 3.
That all his majesty's subjects should be at liberty to serve God
after their own way, in public and private, so nothing was preached
against the royal authority. 4. That the oaths of supremacy
and allegiance, and the tests made in the 25th and 30th years of
Charles II., be discontinued. 5. That all non-conformists be pardoned
for former offences against the penal laws and test. 6. That
abbey and church lands be assured to the possessors.</p>

<p>When the king had irreconcileably quarrelled with the church,
he began to affect a great favour for the dissenters; and, as has
been often hinted, endeavoured to represent the measure of universal
toleration to be intended as much for the benefit of the Protestant
dissenters as of the Catholics. He dwelt upon the rigour of
the church courts, and directed an inquiry to be made into all
the vexatious suits which had been instituted against the dissenters,
and the compositions which had been exacted from them,
under pretence of enforcing the laws. In short, Burnet assures
us, that the royal bed-chamber and drawing-room were as full of
stories to the prejudice of the clergy, as they used formerly to
abound with declamations against the fanatics.</p>

<p>In the preceding lines, the poet had intimated the increase of
trade and wealth; an effect of toleration, much dwelt upon in
James's proclamation for liberty of conscience, and, indeed, the
ostensible cause of its being issued. But Dryden, as every one
else, further augured from the Declaration of Indulgence, under
the circumstances of the time, the speedy downfall of the church
of England, though he is willing to spare the king the odium of
hastening what he represents as the natural consequence of her
own ambition and intolerance. A writer of his party is less scrupulous
in expressing the king's intentions: "So, on the whole
matter, the loyal church of England must either change her old
principles of loyalty, and take example by her Catholic neighbours,
how to behave herself towards a prince who is not of her
persuasion, or she must give his majesty leave not to nourish a
snake in his own bosom, but rather to withdraw his royal protection,
which was promised on account of her constant fidelity:

<p>Dryden insinuates the improbability, that the high and low
church party would long continue in union, since the authority
assumed by Burnet, their present advocate, was inconsistent with
that of Sancroft the primate, Compton bishop of London, and other
leaders of the high church party among the clergy. He resumes
the theme of Burnet's alleged disinclination for episcopacy. In
fact, although his lot cast him into the church of England, the
bishop of Sarum, in many parts of his writings, expresses an unfavourable
opinion of her clergy, whom in one place he calls
the most remiss of any in Europe. Even this harsh expression
is nothing to the following account of the controversy between
the clergy and dissenters, as it stands in the MS. of his history;
for it is greatly softened in the printed copy:</p>

<p>"Many books came out likewise against the church of England.
This alarmed the bishops and clergy much; so that they
set up to preach against rebellion, and the late times, in such a
strain, that it was visible they meant a parallel between these and
the present time. And this produced at last that heat and rage
into which the clergy has run so far, that it is like to end very fatally.
They, on their part, should have shewed more temper,
and more of the spirit of the gospel; whereas, for the greatest
part, they are the worst natured, the fiercest, indiscreetest, and
most persecuting sort of people that are in the nation. There is a
sort of them do so aspire to preferment, that there is nothing so
mean and indecent that they will not do to compass it; and when
they have got into preferments, they take no care, either of themselves,
or of the flocks committed to their charge, but do generally
neglect their parishes. If they are rich enough, they hire some
pitiful curate, at as low a price as they can, and turn all over on
him; or, if their income will not bear out that, they perform the
public offices in the slightest manner they can, but take no care
of their people in the way of private instruction or admonition;
and so do nothing to justify the character of pastors or watchmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
that feed the souls of their people, or watch over them. And
they allow themselves in many indecent liberties, of going to taverns
and ale-houses, and of railing scurrilously against all that
differ from them: and they cherish the profaneness of their
people, if they but come to church, and rail with them against
the dissenters; and are implacably set on the ruin of all that separate
from them, if the course of their lives were otherwise ever
so good and unblameable. In a word, many of them are a reproach
to Christianity and to their profession; and are now, perhaps,
one of the most corrupt bodies of men in the nation."&mdash;<cite>Somers'

<h2>BRITANNIA REDIVIVA.</h2>


<p>The remarkable incident, which gave rise to the following
poem, was hailed by the Catholics with the most unbounded joy.
That party, whose transient prosperity depended upon the declining
life of James II., could hardly enjoy their present power, embittered
as it was by the reflection, that it must end with the
reign of the king and the succession of the Princess of Orange.
Many circumstances seemed to render the hopes of the king having
a male heir of his body extremely precarious. His system
was said to have been injured by early dissipation, and he was
now advanced in life. The queen, also, had been in a bad state
of health; had lost all her children soon after they were born;
and had now, for several years, ceased to have any. Amidst
these discouraging considerations, the queen's pregnancy was announced
in 1687; and even before his birth, addressers and panegyrists
in verse hailed the future prince, as a pledge for the maintenance
of liberty of conscience, and the security of the royal
line.<a name="FNanchor_285_286" id="FNanchor_285_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_286" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>But the Catholics were so transported with this unexpected
happiness, that they could not refrain from spreading an hundred
follies, tending to connect the queen's pregnancy with the efficacy
of the king's faith. Some said, that the queen's conception took
place at the very time when her mother made a vow to the Lady
of Loretto, that her daughter might by her means have a son:
Others attributed it to the queen's personal influence with Saint
Xavier: Others to the intercessions of the Jesuits, among whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the king had enrolled himself: All ascribed so happy and unhoped
an event to something more than mere natural causes,
and ventured to presage, that the joyful fruit of the queen's conception
would prove a son, since otherwise, it was said, God
would have done his work by halves.<a name="FNanchor_286_287" id="FNanchor_286_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_287" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> It is dangerous for a religious
sect to cry, a miracle! for it is always echoed by their
adversaries, shouting out, an imposture! The same circumstances
which induced the Catholics to believe that this happy event was
owing to a peculiar divine interposition, led the nation to ascribe
so unexpected and opportune an occurrence to artifice and imposition;
and they were prepared to pronounce a birth spurious,
which their adversaries had incautiously pushed to the verge of
miraculous.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, 1688, the prince was born, under circumstances
which ought to have removed all suspicion of imposture.
But these suspicions were too deeply rooted in party prejudices
and fears; and it became a distinguishing mark of a true Protestant,
to hold for spurious the birth of a prince, which took
place in the presence of more people than is either consistent with
custom or decency.</p>

<p>In the mean while, public rejoicings, of the most splendid kind,
were solemnized at home and abroad;<a name="FNanchor_287_288" id="FNanchor_287_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_288" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and the poets flocked
with their addresses of congratulation<a name="FNanchor_288_289" id="FNanchor_288_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_289" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> on the birth of a Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of Wales, who was doomed shortly to be distinguished through
the English dominions by the ignominious appellation of Pretender,
and abroad, by the dubious title of Chevalier de St George.
It was peculiarly the part of our author, as poet-laureat, and a
good Catholic, to solemnize an event of so much importance to
the king, and those of his religion, and to bear down, if possible,
the popular prejudice by the exertion of his poetical powers.
"Britannia Rediviva" was written, nine days after the event celebrated,
and published accordingly. It is licensed on the 19th of
June.</p>

<p>In this poem, our author assumes the tone and feeling which we
have described as general among the Catholics, upon this happy
and unexpected event. It is less an address of congratulation
than a solemn devotional hymn; and, even considered as such,
abounds with expressions of awful gratitude, rather for a miraculous
interposition of heaven and the blessed saints, than for a
blessing conferred through the ordinary course of nature. Dryden,
who knew how to assume every style that fitted the occasion,
writes here in the character of a devout and grateful Catholic,
with much of the <em>unction</em> which marks the hymns of the Roman
church. In English poetry, we have hardly another example of
the peculiar tone which the invocation of saints, and an enthusiastic
faith in the mystic doctrines of the Catholic faith, can give
to poetry. To me, I confess, that communion seems to offer the
same facilities to the poet, which it has been long famous for affording
to the painter; and the "Britannia Rediviva," while it
celebrates the mystic influence of the sacred festivals of the Paraclete
and the Trinity, and introduces the warlike forms of St
Michael and St George, has often reminded me of one of the ancient
altar pieces, which it is impossible to regard without reverence,
though presenting miracles which never happened, or saints
who never existed. These subordinate divinities are something
upon which the imagination, dazzled and overwhelmed by the
contemplation of a single Omnipotent Being, can fairly rest and
expand itself. They approach nearer to humanity and to comprehension;
yet are sufficiently removed from both, to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
full effect of sublime obscurity. Dryden has undoubtedly reaped
considerable advantage from religion in the present poem. It
must, however, be owned, that the effect of these passages is much
injured by the frequent allusion to the deities of classical mythology;
and that Dryden has ranked the gods and goddesses of ancient
Rome with the saints of her modern church, in the same indiscriminate
order in which they are classed in the Pantheon.
We have the Giants' War immediately preceding the miracle
wrought on the Shunamite's son; and the serpents of the infant
Hercules are classed in the very sentence with the dragons of the
Apocalypse. On one occasion he has stooped yet lower, and condescended
to pun upon the child's being born on Trinity Sunday,
as promising at least a <em>trine</em> of infant princes.</p>

<p>Still, however, the strain of the poem is, upon the whole, grave
and exalted. Besides the general tone of "Britannia Rediviva,"
there are many passages in it deserving the reader's attention.
The address to the queen, beginning, "But you, propitious
queen," has all the smoothness with which Dryden could vary
the masculine character of his general poetry, when he addressed
the female sex, and forms a marked contrast to the more majestic
tone of the rest of the piece. It may indeed be said of Dryden,
as he himself says of Virgil, that though he is smooth where
smoothness is required, yet he is so far from affecting that general
character, that he seems rather to disdain it.</p>

<p>The original edition of the "Britannia Rediviva" is in quarto,
printed, as usual, for Tonson, with a motto from the first book of
the Georgics, which is now restored. The concluding lines refer to
the death of so many Catholics by the perjured evidences of Oates
and Bedlow:</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The word <em>perjuria</em>, as well as <em>Puerum</em>, in the preceding passage,
are marked by a difference of type; a mode of soliciting the
attention of the reader to a pointed remark or inuendo, which was
first used in Charles II.'s time, and seems to have been introduced
by L'Estrange, who carried it to a most extravagant degree,
chequering his Observators with all manner of characters, from the
Roman to the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>We have noticed, in the introduction, that the birth of a Prince
of Wales, at a time of such critical importance to the Catholic
faith, was looked upon, by the Papists, as little less than miraculous.
Some talked of the petition of the Duchess of Modena to
Our Lady of Loretto; and Burnet affirms, that, in that famous
chapel, there is actually a register of the queen's conception, in
consequence of her mother's vow. But, in that case, the good
duchess's intercession must have been posthumous; for she died
upon the 19th July, and the queen's time run from the 6th of October.
Others ascribed the event to the king's pilgrimage to St
Winifred's Well; and others, among whom was the Earl of Melfort,
suffered their zeal to hurry them into profaneness, and spoke
of the angel of the Lord moving the Bath waters, like the Pool
of Bethsaida. But the Jesuits claimed to their own prayers the
principal merit of procuring this blessing, which, indeed, they had
ventured to prophecy; for, among other devices which that order
exhibited to the English ambassador from James to the Pope,
there was, according to Mr Misson, one of a lily, from whose
leaves distilled some drops of water, which were once supposed, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
naturalists, to become the seed of new lilies: the motto was&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lachrimor

<p>"And the dragon stood before the woman, who was ready to
be delivered, for to devour her child, as soon as it was born,"&mdash;Revel.
xii. 4. Dryden is at pains, by an original marginal note,
which, with others, is restored in this edition, to explain, that, by
this allusion here, and in other parts of the poem, he meant "the
commonwealth's party." The acquittal of the bishops, on the
17th of June, two days before the poem was licensed, must have
excited a prudential reverence for the church of England in the
moment of her triumph. The poet fixes upon this commonwealth
party therefore, exclusively, the common reports which had
been circulated during the queen's pregnancy, and which are thus
noticed in the (supposititious) letter to Father La Chaise: "As to
the queen's being with child, that great concern goes as well as
we could wish, notwithstanding all the satirical discourses of the
heretics, who content themselves to vent their poison in libels,
which, by night, they disperse in the street, or fix upon the walls.
There was one lately found upon a pillar of a church, that imported,
that such a day thanks should be given to God for the
queen's being great with a cushion. If one of these pasquil-makers
could be discovered, he would but have an ill time on't, and
should be made to take his last farewell at Tyburn."</p>

<p>The usual topics of wit, during the queen's pregnancy, were,
allusions to a cushion, a tympany, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and Partridge, the
Protestant almanack-maker, utters the following predictions:&mdash;"That
there was some bawdy project on foot, either about buying,
selling, or procuring, a child or children, for some pious uses."
And, again, "Some child is to be topped upon the lawful heirs, to
cheat them out of their right and estate."&mdash;"God preserve the
kingdom of England from invasion! for about this time I fear it
in earnest, and keep the Protestants there from being dragooned."</p>

<p>One single circumstance is sufficient to rout all suspicions thus
carefully infused into the people. It is well known, and is noticed
in one of L'Estrange's papers at the time, that a similar outcry
was raised during a former pregnancy of the queen; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
child proving a female, there was no use for pushing the calumny
any further upon that occasion.</p>

<p>The public exercise of the Catholic religion in England is compared

the eve of his great victory.</p>

<p>The war against the Turks, which was now raging in Hungary,
seems to have occupied much of James's attention. He amused
himself with anxiety about the fate of this holy warfare, as he probably
thought it, while his own crown was tottering on his head.
In all his letters to the Prince of Orange, he expresses his wishes
for the peace of Christendom, that the emperor and the Venetians
might have leisure to prosecute the war against the Turks;
and conjectures about the taking of Belgrade, and the progress of
the Duke of Lorraine, are very gravely sent, as interesting matter
to the prince, who was anticipating the conquest of England,
and the dethronement of his father-in-law. There may be something
of affectation in this; but, as Dryden takes up the same
tone, it may be supposed to have forwarded James's general conversation,
as well as his letters to the Prince of Orange.&mdash;<em>See</em> <span class="smcap">Dalrymple's</span>

<p>Dryden talks of the Pope with the respect of a good Catholic.
Nevertheless it happened, by a very odd chance, that, while the
throne of England was held by a Catholic, for the first time during
the course of a century, the chair of St Peter was occupied by
Innocent XI. who acquired the uncommon epithet of the Protestant
Pope. He received, with great coldness, the Earl of Castlemain,
whom James sent to Rome as his ambassador, and refused
the only two requests which a king of England had made to Rome
since the days of Henry VIII., although they were only a dispensation
to Petre the king's confessor, to hold a bishopric, and another to the
Mareschal D'Humier's daughter to marry within the prohibited degrees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Nay, the Pope is said to have privately admitted the Prince
of Orange's envoy to his confidence, while he treated Castlemaine
with so much contempt. The cause of this coldness was the
Pope's quarrel with James's ally, Louis, and his dislike to the order
of Jesuits, by whom the king of England was entirely ruled.
In truth, Innocent XI. was much more anxious to maintain the
privileges of the Roman see against those princes who retained
her communion, than to add England to a flock which was become
so mutinous and untractable. He was, besides, a man of no
extended views, and chiefly concerned himself with managing the
papal revenue, involved in debt by a succession of wasteful pontificates.
To this the conversion of England promised no immediate
addition, and, with the narrowness of view natural to his pursuits,
Innocent XI. thought it better to employ his exertions in realizing
an immediate income, than in endeavouring to extend the faith
and authority of the church, by embarking in a design of great
doubt and hazard. He was, therefore, but a very poor representative
of Pope Sylvester. As for the last two lines, they contain,
what we seldom meet with in Dryden's poetry, a compliment not
only bombastic, but unappropriate, and even unmeaning.</p>

<p>In these lines, and the following, where the poet, with indecent
freedom, compares the suspicions entertained of a spurious birth
to the devil's doubts concerning our Saviour's godhead, he alludes
to those circumstances of publicity, which one would have
supposed might have rendered the birth of the prince indisputable.
It took place at ten o'clock in the morning; and eighteen privy
counsellors, besides a number of ladies, were present at the delivery.
But the party violence of the period was so extravagant, as to receive
and circulate a variety of reports, inconsistent with each
other, and agreeing only in the general conclusion, that the child
was an imposition upon the nation. The reasoning of the Bishop
of Salisbury, on this point, is admirably summed up by Smollet.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of June, 1688, the queen was suddenly seized
with labour-pains, and delivered of a son, who was baptized by the
name of James, and declared Prince of Wales. All the Catholics
and friends of James were transported with the most extravagant
joy at the birth of this child; while great part of the nation consoled
themselves with the notion, that it was altogether supposititious.
They carefully collected a variety of circumstances, upon
which this conjecture was founded; and though they were inconsistent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
contradictory, and inconclusive, the inference was so agreeable
to the views and passions of the people, that it made an impression
which, in all probability, will never be totally effaced.
Dr Burnet, who seems to have been at uncommon pains to establish
this belief, and to have consulted all the Whig nurses in England
upon the subject, first pretends to demonstrate, that the
queen was not with child; secondly, that she was with child, but
miscarried; thirdly, that a child was brought into the queen's
apartment in a warming-pan; fourthly, that there was no child at
all in the room; fifthly, that the queen actually bore a child, but
it died that same day; sixthly, that it had the fits, of which it
died at Richmond; therefore, the Chevalier de St George must
be the fruit of four different impostures."</p>

<p>During the five months preceding the birth of the Chevalier de
St George, James was wholly engaged by those feuds and dissensions
which tended to render irreparable the breach between
him and his subjects. The arbitrary attacks upon the privileges
of Magdalen College, and of the Charter-House, fell nearly
within this period. Above all, the petition of the seven bishops
against reading the Declaration of Indulgence, their imprisonment,
their memorable trial and acquittal, had all taken place
since the month of April; and it is well known to what a state of
violent opposition the nation had been urged by a train of arbitrary
acts of violence, so imprudently commenced, and perversely
insisted in. Dryden, like other men of sense, probably began
to foresee the consequences of so violent and general irritation;
and expresses himself in moderate and soothing language, both
as to the past and future. Nothing is therefore dropt which can
offend the church of England. Perhaps they may have been
spared by the royal command; for it seems, as is hinted by a letter
from Halifax to the Prince of Orange, that, not finding his
expectations answered by the dissenters, whom he had so greatly
favoured of late, James entertained thoughts of returning
to his old friends, the High-churchmen; "but the truth is," his
lordship adds, "the Papists have of late been so hard and fierce upon
them, that the very species of those formerly mistaking men is
destroyed; they have so broken that loom in pieces, that they cannot
now set it up again to work upon it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dalrymple's</span> <cite>Memoirs</cite>.

<p>There was, Dryden informs us, a report of the prince's death,
to which he alludes. James, in a letter to the Prince of Orange,
dated June 12, mentions the birth of his son on the Sunday
preceding, and adds, "the child was somewhat ill this last
night, of the wind, and some gripes, but is now, blessed be God,
very well, and like to have no returns of it, and is a strong boy."
About this illness, Burnet tells the following gossipping story:
"That night, one Hemings, a very worthy man, an apothecary by
his trade, who lived in St Martin's Lane, the very next door to a
family of an eminent Papist, (Brown, brother to the Viscount
Montacute, lived there;) the wall between his parlour and their's
being so thin, that he could easily hear any thing that was said
with a louder voice, he (Hemings) was reading in his parlour late
at night, when he heard one come into the neighbouring parlour,
and say, with a doleful voice, the Prince of Wales is dead: Upon
which a great many that lived in the house came down stairs very
quick. Upon this confusion he could not hear any thing more;
but it was plain they were in a great consternation. He went
with the news next morning to the bishops in the Tower. The
Countess of Clarendon came thither soon after, and told them, she
had been at the young prince's door, but was denied access: she
was amazed at it; and asked, if they knew her: they said, they
did; but that the queen had ordered, that no person whatsoever
should be suffered to come in to him. This gave credit to Hemings'
story; and looked as if all was ordered to be kept shut up
close, till another child was found. One, that saw the child two
days after, said to me, that he looked strong, and not like a child
so newly born."</p>

<p>The poem of Dryden plainly proves, that such a report was so
far from being confined among the Catholics, that it was spread
over all the town; and what the worthy Mr Hemings over-heard
in his next neighbour's, the Papist's, might probably have been
heard in any company in London that evening, although the mode
of communication would doubtless have been doleful or joyous,
according to the party and religion of the news-bearer.</p>

<p class="p7">PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES.</p>


<p>The prologue of the English drama was originally, like that of
the ancients, merely a kind of argument of the play, instructing
the audience concerning those particulars of the plot, which were necessary
in order to understand the opening of the piece. That this
might be done more artificially, it was often spoken in the character
of some person connected with the preceding history of the
intrigue, though not properly one of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>. But
when increasing refinement introduced the present mode of opening
the action in the course of the play itself, the prologue became
a preliminary address to the audience, bespeaking their attention
and favour for the piece. The epilogue had always borne
this last character, being merely an extension of the ancient "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">valete
et plaudite</i>;" an opportunity seized by the performers, after
resigning their mimic characters, to pay their respects to the public
in their own, and to solicit its approbation of their exertions.
By degrees it assumed a more important shape, and was indulged
in descanting upon such popular topics as were likely to interest
the audience, even though less immediately connected with the
actor's address of thanks, or the piece they had been performing.
Both the prologue and epilogue had assumed their present character
so early as the days of Shakespeare and Jonson.</p>

<p>With the revival of dramatic entertainments, after the Restoration,
these addresses were revived also; and a degree of consequence
seems to have been attached to them in that witty age,
which they did not possess before, and which has not since been
given to them. They were not only used to propitiate the audience;
to apologize for the players, or poet; or to satirize the follies of
the day, which is now their chief purpose; but they became, during
the collision of contending factions, vehicles of political tenets
and political sarcasm, which could, at no time, be insinuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
with more success, than when clothed in nervous verse, and delivered
with all the advantages of elocution to an audience, whose
numbers rendered the impression of poetry and eloquence more
contagious.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Dryden soon obtained a complete and
absolute superiority in this style of composition over all who pretended
to compete with him. While the harmony of his verse
gave that advantage to the speaker, which was wanting in the
harsh, coarse, broken measure of his contemporaries, his powers
of reasoning and of satire left them as far behind in sense as in
sound. This superiority, and the great influence which he had in
the management of the theatre, made it usual to invoke his assistance
in the case of new plays; many of which he accordingly
furnished either with prologues or epilogues. The players also
had recourse to him upon any remarkable occasion; as, when a
new house was opened; when the theatre was honoured by a visit
from the king or duke; when they played at Oxford, during the
public acts; or, in short, in all cases when an occasional prologue
was thought necessary to grace their performance.</p>

<p>The collection of these pieces, which follows, is far from being
the least valuable part of our author's labours. The variety and
richness of fancy which they indicate, is one of Dryden's most
remarkable poetical attributes. Whether the theme be, the youth
and inexperience or the age and past services, of the author; the
plainness or magnificence of a new theatre; the superiority of ancient
authors, or the exaltation of the moderns; the censure of
political faction, or of fashionable follies; the praise of the monarch,
or the ridicule of the administration; the poet never fails
to treat it with the liveliness appropriate to verses intended to be
spoken, and spoken before a numerous assembly. The manner
which Dryden assumes, varies also with the nature of his audience.
The prologues and epilogues, intended for the London
stage, are written in a tone of superiority, as if the poet, conscious
of the justice of his own laws of criticism, rather imposed
them upon the public as absolute and undeniable, than as standing
in need of their ratification. And if he sometimes condescends
to solicit, in a more humble style, the approbation of the
audience, and to state circumstances of apology, and pleas of favour,
it is only in the case of other poets; for, in the prologues of
his own plays, he always rather demands than begs their applause;
and if he acknowledges any defects in the piece, he takes care to
intimate, that they are introduced in compliance with the evil
taste of the age; and that the audience must take the blame to
themselves, instead of throwing it upon the writer. This bold,
style of address, although it occasionally drew upon our author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the charge of presumption, was, nevertheless, so well supported
by his perception of what was just in criticism, and his powers of
defending even what was actually wrong, that a miscellaneous audience
was, in general, fain to submit to a domination, as successfully
supported as boldly claimed. In the Oxford prologues, on
the other hand, the audience furnished by that seat of the Muses,
as of more competent judgment, are addressed with more respectful
deference by the poet.<a name="FNanchor_330_331" id="FNanchor_330_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_331" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> He seems, in these, to lay down his
rules of criticism, as it were under correction of superior judges;
and intermingles them with such compliments to the taste and
learning of the members of the university, as he disdains to bestow
upon the motley audience of the metropolis. In one style,
the author seems dictating to scholars, whose conceit and presumption
must be lowered by censure, to make them sensible
of their own deficiencies, and induce them to receive the offered
instruction; in the other, he seems to deliver his opinions before
men, whom he acknowledges as his equals, if not his superiors, in
the arts of which he is treating. And although Brown has very
grossly charged Dryden with having affected, for the university,
an esteem and respect, which he was far from really feeling; and
with having exposed its members, in their turn, to the ridicule of
the London audience, whom he had stigmatized in his Oxford prologues
as void of taste and judgment; it is but fair to state, that nothing
can be produced in proof of such an accusation.<a name="FNanchor_331_332" id="FNanchor_331_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_332" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In another
respect, the reader may remark a pleasing difference between the
London prologues and epilogues, and those spoken at Oxford. The
licence of the times permitted, and even exacted from an author,
in these compositions, the indulgence of an indelicate vein of humour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
which, however humiliating, is, in general, successful in a
vulgar or mixed audience, as turning upon subjects adapted to the
meanest capacity. This continued even down to our times; for,
till very lately, it was expected by the mobbish part of the audience,
that they should be indemnified for the patience with
which they had listened to the moral lessons of a tragedy, by the
indecency of the epilogue. In Dryden's time, this coarse raillery
was carried to great excess; but our author, however culpable in
other compositions, is, generally speaking, more correct than his
contemporaries in his prologues and epilogues. In the Oxford
pieces, particularly, where the decorum of manners, suited to that
mother of learning, required him to abstain from all licentious allusion,
Dryden has given some excellent specimens of how little he
needed to rely upon this obvious and vulgar aid, for the amusement
of his audience. Upon the whole, it will be difficult to find
pieces of this occasional nature so interesting and unexceptionable
as those spoken at Oxford. They are, as they ought to be,
by far the most laboured and correct which our author gave to
the stage. It may not be improper to add, that the players were
only permitted to visit Oxford during the Public Acts, which
were frequently celebrated on occasions of public rejoicing. They
acted, it would appear, in a Tennis-court, fitted up as an occasional
theatre; and the prologues and epilogues of Dryden tended
doubtless greatly to conciliate the favour of an audience, consisting
of all that was learned in the generation then mature, and
all that was hopeful in that which was rising to succeed it.</p>

<p>The more miscellaneous prologues and epilogues of Dryden are
not without interest. In ridiculing the vices or follies of the age,
they often touch upon circumstances illustrative of manners;
and certainly, though the modern theatres of the metropolis are
so ill regulated, as nearly to exclude modest females from all
the house, except the private boxes, their decorum is superior
to that of their predecessors. If we conceive the boxes filled
with women, whose masks levelled all distinction between the woman
of fashion and the courtezan; the galleries crowded with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
rabble, more ferocious and ignorant than its present inmates; the
pit occupied by drunken bullies, whose quarrels perpetually interrupted
the performers, and often ended in bloodshed, and even
murder, upon the spot; we shall have occasion to congratulate
ourselves upon being at least in the way of reformation. These
enormities of his time, Dryden has pointed out, and censured in
his strong and nervous satire. It is to be regretted, that his painting
is often coarse, and sometimes intentionally licentious; although,
as has been already observed, more seldom so than that of
most of his contemporaries. The historical antiquary may also glean
some observations on the state of parties, from those pieces which
turn upon the politics of the day; and there occur numerous
hints, which may be useful to an historian of the drama. Thus
the Prologues and Epilogues form no improper supplement to Dryden's
historical poetry.</p>

<p>It remains to say, that all these prologues and epilogues were,
according to the custom of that time, printed on single leaves, or
broadsides, as they are called, and sold by the hawkers at the door
of the theatres. Some of these, but very few, have been preserved
by Mr Luttrell, in the collection belonging to Mr Bindley.
If a set of them existed, I think it probable they would be found
to contain many variations from those editions, which the more
mature reflection of the author gave to the world in the Miscellanies.
But the loss is the less to be lamented, as, in general, the
original editions which I have seen are not only more inaccurate,
but coarser and more licentious, than those which Dryden finally
adopted. In the original prologue of Circe, which is
printed in this edition, for example, the reader will find, that,
in place of the well-known apology for an author's first production,
by an appeal to those of Shakespeare, Fletcher, and
Jonson, his youth is only made the subject of some commonplace
raillery. Indeed, so little value did Dryden himself set
upon these occasional effusions before they were collected, and
so little did he consider them as entitled to live in the recollection
of the public, that, on one occasion at least, but probably
upon several, he actually transferred the same prologue from one
new play to another. Thus he reclaimed, from his adversary
Shadwell's play of "The True Widow," the prologue which he
had furnished, and affixed it to the "Widow Ranter" of Mrs
Behn. Sometimes also he laid under contribution former publications
of his own, which he supposed to be forgotten, in order to
furnish out one of these theatrical prefaces. Thus the satire
against the Dutch furnishes the principal part of the prologue and
epilogue to "Amboyna."</p>

<p>Inaccurate as they seem to have been, the original editions
might have proved useful in arranging the prologues and epilogues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
according to their exact dates, which, where they are not attached
to any particular play, can now only be assigned from internal
evidence. But absolute accuracy in this point, though no doubt
desirable if it can be obtained, does not appear to be a point of
any serious moment; and, after having bestowed considerable
pains, the Editor will neither be much ashamed, nor inconsolably
sorry, to find, that some of the prologues and epilogues have been
misplaced in the order which he has adopted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>The Drury-Lane theatre, after being burned in</em> 1671-2, <em>was rebuilt
upon a plan furnished by Sir Christopher Wren, who superintended
the execution</em>. <em>It is said to have been most admirably
planned, but spoiled by some injudicious alterations in the
course of building. The following Prologue informs us, that the
exterior decorations were plain and simple in comparison to those
of the rival house in Dorset Gardens, which, as repeatedly noticed,
had been splendidly fitted up under the direction of D'Avenant,
noted for his attachment to stage pomp and shew. It
appears that Charles II., who was possessed of considerable
taste, and did not disdain to interest himself in the affairs of the
drama, had himself recommended to the King's company, the
simplicity and frugality of scenery and ornament to which the
poet alludes. The other house were not unapt to boast of the superior
splendour which is here conceded to them. In the epilogue
to</em> "<em>Psyche</em>" <em>the actors boast</em>,</p></blockquote>

<h2>EPILOGUE<br />

<span class="small50">INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY</span><br />

<span class="small80">THE LADY HEN. MAR. WENTWORTH.</span><br />

<span class="small50">WHEN CALISTO WAS ACTED AT COURT, IN 1675.</span></h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Calisto, or the Chaste Nymph</em>," <em>was a masque written by John Crowne,
who, by the interference of Rochester, was employed to compose such an
entertainment to be exhibited at court, though this was an encroachment
on the office of Dryden, the poet laureat. The principal characters were
represented by the daughters of the Duke of York, and the first nobility.
The Lady Mary, afterwards Queen, to whom the masque was dedicated,
acted Calisto; Nyphe was represented by the Lady Anne,
who also succeeded to the throne; Jupiter, by Lady Harriot
Wentworth; Psecas, by Lady Mary Mordaunt; Diana, by Mrs
Blague, and Mercury by Mrs Sarah Jennings, afterwards Duchess
of Marlborough. Among the attendant nymphs and dancers were
the Countesses of Pembroke and of Derby, Lady Catharine Herbert,
Mrs Fitzgerald, and Mrs Fraser. The male dancers were
the Duke of Monmouth, Viscount Dunblaine, Lord Daincourt,
and others of the first quality. Although the exhibition of this
masque, which it was the privilege of his office to have written, must
have been somewhat galling to Dryden, we see that he so far suppressed
his feelings as to compose the following Epilogue, which, to
his farther mortification, was rejected, through the interference of
Rochester.</em></p>

<p><em>The Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth, Baroness of Nettlested, who
acted the part of Jupiter on the present occasion, afterwards adapted
her conduct to that of Calisto, and became the mistress of the
Duke of Monmouth. He was so passionately attached to her, that
upon the scaffold he vindicated their intercourse by some very warm
and enthusiastic expressions, and could by no means be prevailed
on to express any repentance of it as unlawful. This lady died about
a year after the execution of her unfortunate lover</em>, <em>in</em> 1685. <em>Her mother,
Lady Wentworth, ordered a monument of L.</em> 2000 <em>value to be
erected over her in the church of Teddington, Bedfordshire</em>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><em>This play, which long maintained a high degree of reputation on the
stage, presents us with the truest picture of what was esteemed good
breeding and wit in the reign of Charles II. All the characters,
from Dorimant down to the Shoemaker, were either really drawn
from the life, or depicted so accurately according to the manners of
the times, that each was instantly ascribed to some individual. Sir
Fopling Flutter, in particular, was supposed to represent Sir George
Hewit, mentioned in the Essay on Satire, and who seems to have
been one of the most choice coxcombs of the period. A very severe
criticism in the</em> Spectator, <em>pointing out the coarseness as well as
the immorality of this celebrated performance, had a great effect in
diminishing its popularity. The satire being in fact personal, it followed
as a matter of course, that the Prologue should disclaim all personality,
that being an attribute to be discovered by the audience, but not
avowed by the poet. Dryden has accomplished this with much liveliness,
and enumerates for our edification the special fopperies which
went to make up a complete fine gentleman in</em> 1676&mdash;<em>differing only
in form from those required in</em> 1806, <em>excepting that the ancient beau
needed, to complete his character, a slight sprinkling of literary accomplishment,
which the modern has discarded with the</em> "<em>sacred periwig</em>."</p></blockquote>

<h2>PROLOGUE<br />

<span class="small50">TO</span><br />

<span class="small80">THE TRUE WIDOW, 1679.</span></h2>

<hr class="r10" />


<p>At this period Shadwell and our author were on such good
terms, that Dryden obliged him with the following Prologue to
the "True Widow;" a play intended to display the humours of
various men of the town. Thus we have in the Dramatis Personæ,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p8">"<i class="personaeb">Selfish.</i> A coxcomb, conceited of his beauty, wit, and breeding,
thinking all women in love with him, always admiring and
talking to himself.</p>

<p class="p8"><i class="personaeb">Old Maggot.</i> An old, credulous fellow; a great enemy to wit,
and a lover of business for business-sake.</p>

<p class="p8"><i class="personaeb">Young Maggot.</i> His nephew: an inns-of-court man, who neglects
law, and runs mad after wit, pretending much to love, and
both in spite of nature, since his face makes him unfit for one,
and his brains for the other.</p>

<p class="p8"><i class="personaeb">Prig.</i> A coxcomb, who never thinks or talks of any thing but
dogs, horses, hunting, hawking, bowls, tennis, and gaming; a rook,
a most noisy jockey.</p>

<p class="p8"><i class="personaeb">Lump.</i> A methodical coxcomb, as regular as a clock, and goes
as true as a pendulum; one that knows what he shall do every
day of his life by his almanack, where he sets down all his actions
before-hand; a mortal enemy to wit."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So many characters, so minutely described, lead us to suppose,
that some personal satire lay concealed under them; and, accordingly,
the Prologue seems to have been written with a view of deprecating
the resentment which this idea might have excited in
the audience. We learn, however, by the Preface, that the piece
was unfavourably received, "either through the calamity of the
time (during the Popish plot), which made people not care for diversions,
or through the anger of a great many who thought themselves
concerned in the satire." The piece is far from being devoid
of merit; and the characters, though drawn in Shadwell's coarse,
harsh manner, are truly comic. That of the jockey, since so popular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
seems to have been brought upon the stage for the first
time in the "True Widow." It is remarkable, that, though
Dryden writes the Prologue, the piece contains a sly hit at him.
Maggot, finding himself married to a portionless jilt, says, "I
must e'en write hard for the play-house; I may get the reversion
of the poet-laureat's place." This, however, might be only meant
as a good-humoured pleasantry among friends.</p>

<p>After the deadly quarrel with Shadwell, our author seems to
have resumed his property in the Prologue, as it is prefixed to
"The Widow Ranter, or The History of Bacon in Virginia,"
a tragi-comedy by Mrs Behn, acted in 1690.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Sophonisba was play of N. Lee, first acted about</em> 1676. <em>It is in
the taste of the French stage, and of the romances of Calprenede
and Scuderi. Hannibal and Massinissa are introduced in the
character of whining love-sick adorers of relentless beauty. This
prevailing taste is admirably ridiculed by Boileau, in a dialogue
where a scene is laid in the infernal regions. In the prologue
spoken at Oxford, which was always famous for Tory principles,
our author ventures to ridicule the Popish Plot, and to predict
the consequences of the predominance of fanatical principles to
the studies cultivated in the University.</em></p></blockquote>

upon a part of the company having attended the Duke to Scotland,

during his residence at Holy Rood House, the amusements
of the theatre. I can say little about the actors commemorated in
the following verses, excepting, that their stage was erected in the
tennis-court of the palace, which was afterwards converted into some
sort of manufactory, and finally, burned down many years ago. Besides

<h2>PROLOGUE<br />

<span class="small50">TO THE</span><br />

<span class="small80">LOYAL BROTHER</span>, <span class="smcap">or the</span> PERSIAN PRINCE.</h2>

<hr class="r5a" />

<p>The "Loyal Brother, or the Persian Prince," was the first
play of Southerne, afterwards so deservedly famous as a tragic
poet. It is said to be borrowed from a novel, called, "Tachmas,
Prince of Persia." The character of the Loyal Brother is obviously
designed as a compliment to the Duke of York, whose
adherents and opponents now divided the nation. Southerne was
at this time but three-and-twenty. It is said, that, upon offering
Dryden five guineas for the following prologue, which had hitherto
been the usual compliment made him for such favours, the
bard returned the money; and added, "not that I do so out of
disrespect to you, young man, but the players have had my goods
too cheap. In future, I must have ten guineas." Southerne was
the first poet who drew large profit from the author's nights; insomuch,
that he is said to have cleared by one play seven hundred
pounds; a circumstance that greatly surprised Dryden, who seldom
gained by his best pieces more than a seventh part of the sum.
From these circumstances, Pope, in his verses to Southerne on his
birth-day, distinguishes him as</p>

<div class="containera">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Tom, whom heaven sent down to raise</div>
  <div class="i0">The price of prologues and of plays.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The prologue, as might be expected, is very severe upon the
Whigs; and alludes to all the popular subjects of dispute between
the factions. The refusal of supplies, and the petition against
the king's guards, are slightly noticed, but the great pope-burning
is particularly dwelt upon; and probably the reader will
be pleased with an opportunity of comparing the account in the
prologue with that given by Roger North, who seems to have entertained
the same fear with Dryden, that the rabble might chuse
to cry, God save the king, at Whitehall.</p>

<p>"But, to return to our tumults.&mdash;After it was found that there
was to be a reinforcement at the next anniversary, which was in
1682, it is not to be thought that the court was asleep, or that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
king would not endeavour to put a stop to this brutal outrage.
His majesty thought fit to take the ordinary regular course; which
was, to send for the lord mayor, &amp;c. and to charge him to prevent
riots in the city. So the lord mayor and sheriffs attended the king
in council; and there they were told, that dangerous tumults and
disorders were designed in the city upon the 17th of November
next, at night, on pretence of bonfires; and his majesty expected
that they, who were entrusted with the government of the city, for
keeping the peace, should, by their authority, prevent all such riotous
disorders, which, permitted to go on, was a misdemeanour of their
whole body. Then one of them came forward, and, in a whining
tone, told the king, that they did not apprehend any danger to
his majesty, or the city, from these bonfires; there was an ardour
of the people against popery, which they delighted to express in
that manner, but meant no harm: And, if they should go about
to hinder them, it would be taken as if they favoured popery;
and, considering the great numbers, and their zeal, it might make
them outrageous, which, let alone, would not be; and perhaps
they themselves might not be secure in resisting them, no not in
their own houses; and they hoped his majesty would not have
them so exposed, so long as they could assure his majesty that
care should be taken, that, if they went about any ill thing, they
should be prevented: or to this purpose, as I had it from undoubted
authority. This was the godly care they had of the public
peace, and the repose of the city; by which the king saw plainly
what they were, and what was to be expected from them. There
wanted not those who suggested the sending regiments into the
city; but the king (always witty) said, he did not love to play
with his horse. But his majesty ordered that a party of horse
should be drawn up, and make a strong guard on the outside of
Temple-Bar; and all the other guards were ordered to be in a
posture at a minute's warning; and so he took a middle, but secure
and inoffensive way; and these guards did not break up till
all the rout was over.</p>

<p>"There were not a few in the court who either feared or favoured
these doings; it may be both; the former being the cause
of the latter. This puts me in mind of a passage told me by one
present. It was of the Lord Archbishop of York, Dolben, who
was a goodly person, and corpulent; he came to the Lord Chief-Justice
North, and, my lord, said he, (clapping his hand upon
his great self,) what shall we do with these tumults of the people?
They will bear all down before them. My lord, said the Chief
Justice, fear God, and don't fear the people. A good hint from a
man of law to an archbishop. But when the day of execution
was come, all the show-fools of the town had made sure of places;
and, towards the evening, there was a great clutter in the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
with taking down glass-windows, and faces began to show themselves
thereat; and the hubbub was great, with the shoals of
people come there, to take or seek accommodation. And, for
the greater amazement of the people, somebody had got up to the
statue of Elizabeth, in the nich of Temple-Bar, and set her out
like an heathen idol. A bright shield was hung upon her arm,
and a spear put in, or leaned upon, the other hand; and lamps,
or candles, were put about, on the wall of the nich, to enlighten
her person, that the people might have a full view of the deity
that, like the goddess Pallas, stood there as the object of the solemn
sacrifice about to be made. There seemed to be an inscription
upon the shield, but I could not get near enough to discern
what it was, nor divers other decorations; but whatever they
were, the eyes of the rout were pointed at them, and lusty shouts
were raised, which was all the adoration could be paid before the
grand procession came up. I could fix in no nearer post than
the Green-Dragon Tavern, below in Fleet-Street; but, before I
settled in my quarters, I rounded the crowd, to observe, as well as
I could, what was doing, and saw much, but afterwards heard
more of the hard battles and skirmishes, that were maintained
from windows and balconies of several parties with one and the
other, and with the floor, as the fancy of Whig and Tory incited.
All which were managed with the artillery of squibs, whereof
thousands of vollies went off, to the great expence of powder and
paper, and profit to the poor manufacturer; for the price of ammunition
rose continually, and the whole trade could not supply
the consumption of an hour or two.</p>

<p>"When we had posted ourselves at windows, expecting the play
to begin, it was very dark, but we could perceive the street to fill,
and the hum of the crowd grew louder and louder; and, at length,
with help of some lights below, we could discern, not only upwards
towards the Bar, where the squib war was maintained, but
downwards towards Fleet-Bridge, the whole street was crowded
with people, which made that which followed seem very strange;
for, about eight at night, we heard a din from below, which came
up the street, continually increasing, till we could perceive a motion;
and that was a row of stout fellows, that came, shouldered
together, cross the street, from wall to wall, on each side. How
the people melted away, I cannot tell; but it was plain these fellows
made clear board, as if they had swept the street for what
was to come after. They went along like a wave; and it was
wonderful to see how the crowd made way: I suppose the good
people were willing to give obedience to lawful authority. Behind
this wave (which, as all the rest, had many lights attending)
there was a vacancy, but it filled a-pace, till another like wave
came up; and so four or five of these waves passed, one after another;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and then we discerned more numerous lights, and throats
were opened with hoarse and tremendous noise; and, with that,
advanced a pageant, borne along above the heads of the crowd,
and upon it sat an huge Pope, in <em>pontificalibus</em>, in his chair, with
a reasonable attendance for state; but his premier minister, that
shared most of his ear, was, Il Signior Diavolo, a nimble little
fellow, in a proper dress, that had a strange dexterity in climbing
and winding about the chair, from one of the pope's ears to the
other.</p>

<p>"The next pageant was of a parcel of Jesuits; and after that
(for there was always a decent space between them) came another,
with some ordinary persons with halters, as I took it, about their
necks; and one with a stenterophonic tube, sounded&mdash;Abhorrers!
Abhorrers! most infernally; and, lastly, came one, with a single
person upon it, which, some said, was the pamphleteer Sir Roger
L'Estrange, some the King of France, some the Duke of York;
but, certainly, it was a very complaisant civil gentleman, like the
former, that was doing what every body pleased to have him, and,
taking all in good part, went on his way to the fire; and however
some, to gratify their fancy, might debase his character, yet certainly
he was a person of high quality, because he came in the
place of state, which is last of all. When these were passed, our
coast began to clear, but it thickened upwards, and the noise increased;
for, as we were afterwards informed, these stately figures
were planted in a demilune about an huge fire, that shined upon
them; and the balconies of the club were ready to crack with
their factious load, till the good people were satiated with the
fine show; and then the hieroglyphic monsters were brought condignly
to a new light of their own making, being, one after another,
added to increase the flames: all which was performed
with fitting salvos of the rabble, echoed from the club, which
made a proper music to so pompous a sacrifice. Were it not for
the late attempts to have renewed these barbarities,<a name="FNanchor_369_370" id="FNanchor_369_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_370" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> it had been
more reasonable to have forgot the past, that such a stain might
not have remained upon the credit of human kind, whom we
would not have thought obnoxious to any such; but, as it is now
otherwise, all persons, that mean humanely, ought to discourage
them; and one way is, to expose the factious brutality of such
unthinking rabble sports, by showing, as near as we can, how
really they were acted; the very knowledge of which, one would
think, should make them for ever to be abhorred and detested of
all rational beings."&mdash;<span class="smcap">North's</span> <cite>Examen</cite>.</p>

<p><em>This play is founded on the novel of the Impertinent Curiosity, in Don
Quixote. It possesses no extraordinary merit. The satire of the
Prologue, though grossly broad, is very forcibly expressed; and describes
what we may readily allow to have been the career of many,
who set up for persons of wit and honour about town.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>PROLOGUE<br />

<span class="small50">UPON THE</span><br />

<span class="small70">UNION OF THE TWO COMPANIES, IN 1686.</span></h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<blockquote>

<p><em>The two rival Companies, so long known by the names of the King's
and the Duke's players, after exhausting every effort, both of poetry
and machinery, to obtain a superiority over each other, were, at
length, by the expence of these exertions, and the inconstancy of the
public, reduced to the necessity of uniting their forces, in order to
maintain their ground. "Taste and fashion," says Colley Cibber,
"with us, have always had wings, and fly from one public spectacle
to another so wantonly, that I have been informed, by those who remember
it, that a famous puppet-show, in Salisbury-change, then
standing where Cecil-street now is, so far distressed these two celebrated
companies, that they were reduced to petition the king for relief
against it. Nor ought we, perhaps, to think this strange, when,
if I mistake not, Terence himself reproaches the Roman auditors of
his time with the like fondness for the</em> funambuli, <em>the rope-dancers.
Not to dwell too long, therefore, upon that part of my history, which
I have only collected from oral tradition, I shall content myself with
telling you, that Mohun and Hart now growing old, (for above thirty
years before this time, they had severally borne the king's commission
of major and captain in the civil wars,) and the younger actors,
as Goodman, Clark, and others, being impatient to get into their
parts, and growing intractable, the audiences too of both houses
then falling off, the patentees of each, by the king's advice, (which,
perhaps, amounted to a command,) united their interests, and both
companies into one, exclusive of all others, in the year</em> 1684. <em>This
union was, however, so much in favour of the Duke's company, that
Hart left the stage upon it, and Mohun survived not long after."</em><a name="FNanchor_388_389" id="FNanchor_388_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_389" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>

James loved to be greeted.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Lodowick Carlell, according to Langbaine, was an ancient courtier,
being gentleman of the bows to King Charles I., groom of the king and
queen's privy chamber, and servant to the queen-mother many years.
His plays, the same author adds, were well esteemed of, and acted
chiefly at the private house in Blackfriars. They were seven in
number. "Arviragus and Philicia" consisted of two parts, and
was first printed in 8vo, 1639. The prologue, which was spoken
upon the revival of the piece, turns upon the caprice of the town, in
preferring, to the plays of their own poets, the performances of a
troop of French comedians, who, it seems, were then acting both
tragedies and comedies in their own language.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><em>"The Prophetess" of Beaumont and Fletcher, even in its original state,
required a good deal of machinery; for it contains stage directions
for thunder-bolts brandished from on high, and for a chariot drawn
through mid air by flying dragons; but it was now altered into an
opera, with the addition of songs and scenical decorations, by Betterton,
in 1690. Our author wrote the following prologue, to introduce
it upon the stage in its altered state. The music was by Henry Purcell,
and is said to have merited applause. Rich, whose attachment to
scenery and decoration is ridiculed by Pope, revived this piece, and
piqued himself particularly upon a set of dancing chairs, which he
devised for the nonce.</em></p>

<p><em>The prologue gave offence to the court, and was prohibited by the Earl
of Dorset, Lord Chamberlain, after the first day's representation. It
contains, Cibber remarks, some familiar metaphorical sneers at
the Revolution itself; and as the poetry is good, the offence was less
pardonable. King William was at this time prosecuting his campaigns
in Ireland; and the author not only ridicules the warfare in
which he was engaged, and the English volunteers who attended him,
but even the government of Queen Mary in his absence.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><em>The old Play, to which this prologue was prefixed upon its revival,
was originally acted in</em> 1634, <em>three or four years after
the appearance of Jonson's</em> "<em>Alchemist;</em>" <em>to which, therefore,
it could not possibly afford any hint. Dryden, observing the resemblance
between the plays, took the plagiarism for granted, because
the style of "Albumazar" is certainly the most antiquated.
This appearance of antiquity is, however, only a consequence of
the vein of pedantry which runs through the whole piece. It was
written by &mdash;&mdash; Tomkins, a scholar of Trinity College, and acted
before King James VI. by the gentlemen of that house, 9th
March</em>, 1614. <em>It is, upon the whole, a very excellent play; yet
the author, whether consulting his own taste, or that of our British
Solomon, before whom it was to be represented, has contrived to
give it an air of such learned stiffness, that it much more resembles
the translation of a play from Terence or Plautus, than an original
English composition. By this pedantic affectation, the humour
of the play is completely smothered; and although there
are several very excellent comic situations in the action</em>, <em>yet neither
the attempt to revive it in Dryden's time,</em> <em>nor those which followed
in</em> 1748 <em>and</em> 1773, <em>met with any success</em>.</p>

<h2>MAC-FLECNOE.</h2>


<p>The enmity between Dryden and Shadwell at first probably
only sprung from some of those temporary causes of disgust, which
must frequently divide persons whose lives are spent in a competition
for public applause. That they were occasionally upon tolerable
terms is certain, for Dryden has told us so; and Shadwell,
in 1676, when expressing his dissent from one of our author's
rules of theatrical criticism, industriously and anxiously
qualifies his opinion, with the highest compliments to our author's
genius.<a name="FNanchor_411_412" id="FNanchor_411_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_412" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> They had formerly even joined forces, and called in the
aid of another wit, to overwhelm the reputation of no less a person
than Elkanah Settle.<a name="FNanchor_412_413" id="FNanchor_412_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_413" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> But, between the politics of the stage
and of the nation, the friendship of these bards, which probably
never had a very solid foundation, was at length totally overthrown.
It is not very easy to discover who struck the first blow; but it
may be suspected, that Dryden was displeased to see Shadwell
not only dispute his canons of criticism in print, but seem to establish
himself as an imitator of the old school of dramatic composition,
and particularly of Jonson, on whom Dryden had thrown
some censure in his epilogue to "The Conquest of Grenada," and
in the Defence of these verses. It seems certain, that the feud
had broke out in 1675-6; for Shadwell has not only made some
invidious allusions to the success of "Aureng-Zebe," which was
represented that season, but has plainly intimated, that he needed
only a pension to enable him to write as well as Dryden himself.<a name="FNanchor_413_414" id="FNanchor_413_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_414" class="fnanchor">[413]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
This assault, however, seems to have been forgiven; for Dryden
obliged Shadwell with an epilogue to the "True Widow," acted
in 1678. But their precarious reconcilement did not long subsist,
when political animosity was added to literary rivalry. Shadwell
not only wrote the "Lancashire Witches," in ridicule of
the Tory party, but entered into a personal contest with our author
on the subject of "The Medal," which he answered by a
clumsy, though venomous, retort, called "The Medal of John
Bayes." In the preface he asserts, that no one can think Dryden
"hardly dealt with, since he knows, and so do all his old acquaintance,
that there is not one untrue word spoke of him."
Neither was this a single offence; for Dryden, in his "Vindication
of the Duke of Guise," says, that Shadwell has repeatedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
called him Atheist in print. These reiterated insults at
length drew down the vengeance of our poet, who seems to
have singled Shadwell from the herd of those who had libelled
him, to be gibbetted in rhyme while the English language shall
last. Neither was Dryden satisfied with a single attack upon this
obnoxious bard; but, having divided his poetical character from
that which he held as a political writer, he discussed the first in
the satire which follows, and the last, with equal severity, in the
Second Part of "Absalom and Achitophel." These two admirable
pieces of satire appeared within less than a month of each
other; and leave it a matter of doubt, whether the bitter ridicule
of the anointed Prince of Dulness, or the sarcastic description of
Og, the seditious poetaster, be most cruelly severe.</p>

<p>"Mac-Flecnoe" must be allowed to be one of the keenest satires
in the English language. It is what Dryden has elsewhere
termed a Varronian satire;<a name="FNanchor_414_415" id="FNanchor_414_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_415" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> that is, as he seems to use the phrase,
one in which the author is not contented with general sarcasm
upon the object of attack, but where he has woven his piece into
a sort of imaginary story, or scene, in which he introduces
the person, whom he ridicules, as a principal actor. The position
in which Dryden has placed Shadwell is the most mortifying
to literary vanity which can possibly be imagined, and is hardly
excelled by the device of Pope in the "Dunciad," who has obviously
followed the steps of his predecessor. Flecnoe, who seems to
have been universally acknowledged as the very lowest of all poetasters,
and whose name had passed into a proverb for doggrel
verse and stupid prose, is represented as devolving upon Shadwell
that pre-eminence over the realms of Dulness, which he had himself
possessed without a rival. The spot chosen for this devolution
of empire is the Barbican, an obscure suburb, in which it
would seem that there were temporary theatrical representations
of the lowest order, among other receptacles of vulgar dissipation,
for the amusement of the very lowest of the vulgar. Here
the ceremony of Shadwell's coronation is supposed to be performed
with an inaugural oration by Flecnoe, his predecessor, in which
all his pretensions to wit and to literary fame are sarcastically
enumerated and confuted, by a counter-statement of his claims to
distinction by pre-eminent and unrivalled stupidity. In this satire,
the shafts of the poet are directed with an aim acutely malignant.
The inference drawn concerning Shadwell's talents is general
and absolute; but in the proof, Dryden appeals with triumph
to those parts only of his literary character which are obviously
vulnerable. He reckons up among his titles to the throne of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Flecnoe, his desperate and unsuccessful attempts at lyrical composition,
in the opera of "Psyche;" the clumsy and coarse limning
of those whom he designed to figure as fine gentlemen in his
comedies; the false and florid taste of his dedications; his presumptuous
imitation of Jonson in composition, and his absurd resemblance
to him in person. But the satirist industriously keeps
out of view those points, in which perhaps he internally felt some
inferiority to the object of his wrath. He mentions nothing that
could recal to the reader's recollection that insight into human
life, that acquaintance with the foibles and absurdities displayed
in individual pursuits, that bold though coarse delineation of character,
which gave fame to Shadwell's comedies in the last century,
and renders them amusing even at the present day. This
discrimination is an excellent proof of the exquisite address with
which Dryden wielded the satirical weapon, and managed the
feelings of his readers. We never find him attempting a desperate
or impossible task; at least in a way which seems, in the moment
of perusal, desperate or impossible. He never wastes his
powder against the impregnable part of a fortress, but directs all
his battery against some weaker spot, where a breach may be rendered
practicable. In short, by convincing his reader that he is
right in the examples which he quotes, he puts the question at
issue upon the ground most disadvantageous for his antagonist,
and renders it very difficult for one who has been proved a dunce
in one instance to establish his credit in any other.</p>

<p>I have had so frequently to call the attention of my reader to
the sonorous and emphatic effect of Dryden's versification, that it
is almost ridiculous to repeat epithets which apply to every poem
which succeeded his <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite>; yet I cannot but remark,
that the mock heroic may be said to have owed its rise to our author,
and that there is hardly any poem, before "Mac-Flecnoe,"
in which it has been employed with all its qualities of grave and
pompous irony, expressed in solemn and sounding verse.</p>

<p>It is no inconsiderable part of the merit of "Mac-Flecnoe,"
that it led the way to the "Dunciad:" yet, while we acknowledge
the more copious and variegated flow of Pope's satire, we must
not forget, that, independent of the merit of originality, always
inestimable, Dryden's poem claims that of a close and more compact
fable, of a single and undisturbed aim. Pope's ridicule and
sarcasm is scattered so wide, and among such a number of authors,
that it resembles small shot discharged at random among a
crowd; while that of Dryden, like a single well-directed bullet,
prostrates the individual object against whom it was directed.
Besides, the reader is apt to sympathise with the degree of the satirist's
provocation, which, in Dryden's case, cannot be disputed;
whereas Pope sometimes confounds those, from whom he had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
gross incivility, with others who had given him no offence,
and with some whose characters were above his accusation.
To posterity, the "Mac-Flecnoe" possesses a decided
superiority over the "Dunciad," for a very few facts make us
master of the argument; while that of the latter poem, excepting
the Sixth Book, where the satire is more general, requires a note
at every tenth line to render it even intelligible.</p>

<p>Mr Malone has given us the title of the first edition of "Mac-Flecnoe,"
which the present Editor has never seen, as indeed it is
of the last degree of rarity. It was published not by Tonson, but
by D. Green, and entitled, "Mac-Flecnoe, or a Satire on the
True-blue<a name="FNanchor_415_416" id="FNanchor_415_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_416" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Protestant Poet, T. S.; by the Author of Absalom
and Achitophel." It consisted only of one sheet and a half, and
was sold for twopence. The satire was too personal, and too poignant,
to fail in attracting immediate attention, and accordingly
the poem was quickly sold off. It was not republished until it
appeared in Tonson's first Miscellany, in 1684, with a few slight
alterations, intended either to point particular verses, or to correct
errors of the press, or pen. It must have been generally
known, that Dryden was the author of this satire, both because it
is stated in the title-page to be by the author of "Absalom and
Achitophel," and because there existed no contemporary poet to
whom so masterly a production could have been ascribed, even
with remote probability; yet Shadwell, in his dedication of the
tenth satire of Juvenal, (a most miserable performance,) says, that
Dryden, when he taxed him with being the author, "denied it
with all the execrations he could think of;" an accusation which
was echoed by Brown, though apparently upon the authority of
Shadwell alone.<a name="FNanchor_416_417" id="FNanchor_416_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_417" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> From this averment, which is probably made
far too broadly, we can only infer, that Dryden, like Swift in
the same predicament, left his adversary to prove what he had
no title to call upon him to confess; for that he seriously meant
to disavow a performance, of which he had from the very beginning
sufficiently avouched himself the author, can hardly be
supposed for a moment. It has indeed been noticed, that our
author has omitted this poem, as well as the "Eulogy on Cromwell,"
in a list of his plays and poems subjoined to one of his
plays; but Dryden might not think fit to admit a personal,
and what he probably considered as a fugitive satire, into a formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
list of his poetry. We know he entertained a conscious
sense of his dignity in this respect; for, excepting in a slight and
passing sarcasm, he never deigned to answer any of his literary
adversaries, excepting Settle and Shadwell; and he might possibly
think, on reflection, that he had done the latter too much honour
in making him the subject of a separate and laboured poem.
Mr Malone also conceives, that he might be with-held from inserting
this poem in an authoritative list of his works, by delicacy
towards Dorset, his recent benefactor, who had thought Shadwell
worthy of the laurel of which our poet had been divested at the
Revolution. Be it as it may, he was afterwards so far from disowning
the poem, that, in the Essay on Satire, he gives it, with
"Absalom and Achitophel," as instances of his own attempts at
the Varronian satire.</p>

<p>The purpose and scope of "Mac-Flecnoe" was strangely misconstrued
by the object of it, and by our poet's editors. Shadwell
took it into his head, that Dryden meant seriously to tax
him with being an Irishman; a charge which he seems more anxious
to refute than seems necessary. Cibber, or whoever wrote
Dryden's Life in the collection bearing his name, supposes, that
Flecnoe, who died in 1678, had actually succeeded our author in
the office of poet-laureat. Derrick, though he corrects this error,
has fallen into another, in which he is followed by Dr Johnson,
who considers "Mac-Flecnoe" as written in express ridicule of
Shadwell's inauguration as court poet. The scarcity of the first
edition of "Mac-Flecnoe" might have been some excuse for these
errors, had not the piece been printed in the first Miscellany, in
1684, four years before Dryden's being deposed, and Shadwell
succeeding him. Certainly the two events tallied strangely; and
the friends of Shadwell might have considered the substantial office
which he gained by the downfall of Dryden, as a just compensation
for the ludicrous and mock dignity with which his foe

  <div class="i0">Through all the realms of Nonsense, absolute.</div>
  <div class="i0">This aged prince, now flourishing in peace,</div>
  <div class="i0">And blest with issue of a large increase,</div>
  <div class="i0">Worn out with business, did at length debate</div>
  <div class="i0">To settle the succession of the state;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, pondering which of all his sons was fit</div>

  <div class="i0">Cried,&mdash;'Tis resolved! for nature pleads, that he</div>

  <div class="i0">Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,</div>

  <div class="i0">But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray,</div>
  <div class="i0">His rising fogs prevail upon the day.</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, his goodly fabric fills the eye,</div>
  <div class="i0">And seems designed for thoughtless majesty;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain,</div>

  <div class="i0">My warbling lute,&mdash;the lute I whilom strung,</div>

<p>Richard Flecknoe, the unfortunate bard whom our author has
damned to everlasting fame, was by birth an Irishman, and by
profession a Roman Catholic priest. Marvel, who seems to have
known him at Rome, describes his person as meagre in the extreme,
and his itch for scribbling as incessant. The poem, in
which Marvel depicts him, is in the old taste of extravagant burlesque,
and the lines are as rugged as Flecknoe could himself have
produced. It contains, however, some witty and some humorous
description, and the reader may be pleased to see a specimen:</p>

  <div class="i0">I for some branch of Melchizedec took,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though he derives himself from my Lord Brooke,</div>
  <div class="i0">I sought his lodging, which is at the sign</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the sad Pelican, subject divine</div>
  <div class="i0">For poetry. There, three stair-cases high,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which signifies his triple property,</div>

  <div class="i0">There neither was a ceiling, nor a sheet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Save that the ingenious door did, as you come,</div>
  <div class="i0">Turn in, and show to wainscot half the room;</div>

<p>It appears that Flecknoe either laid aside, or disguised, his spiritual
character, when he returned to England; but he still preserved
extensive connections with the Roman Catholic nobility
and gentry.<a name="FNanchor_445_446" id="FNanchor_445_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_446" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> He probably wrote upon many occasional subjects,
but his poetry has fallen into total oblivion. I have particularly
sought in vain for his verses to King John of Portugal, to
which Dryden alludes a little lower. Langbaine mentions four of
his plays, namely, "Damoiselles a la Mode," "Erminia," "Love's
Dominion," and "Love's Kingdom," (of which more hereafter;)
but none of these were ever acted, excepting the last. This
gave Flecknoe great indignation, which he thus vents against the
players in his preface to "Damoiselles a la Mode." "For the acting
of this comedy, those who have the governing of the stage
have their humour, and would be entreated; and I have mine,
and won't entreat them: and were all dramatic writers of my
mind, they should wear their old plays thread-bare before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
should have any new, till they better understood their own interest,
and how to distinguish betwixt good and bad." Notwithstanding
this ill usage, he honoured the players so far, as to prefix
to each character, in the <cite>dramatis personæ</cite> of his pieces, the
name of the actor, by whom, had the managers been less inexorable,
he meant it should have been performed. But this he did
for the sake of the gentle reader, whom he assures, that a lively
imagination being thus assisted in bodying forth the character, he
may receive as much pleasure from the perusal as from the actual
representation of the performance. Flecknoe bore the damnation
of the only one of his plays which was represented, with the same
valiant indifference with which he supported the rebuffs of the players.
In short, he seems to have been fitted for an incorrigible scribbler,
by a happy fund of self-satisfaction, upon which neither the
censures of criticism, nor the united hisses of a whole nation, could
make the slightest impression. When or how Flecknoe died is
uncertain, and of very little consequence; I presume, however,
that he was dead when this satire was published. I am uncertain
whether the reader will think, that this poor poetaster merited
mercy at the hands of Dryden, for the following lines which he
had written in his praise, and which, at any rate, may serve as a
specimen of Flecknoe's poetry:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Dryden, the muses darling and delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than whom none ever flew so high a flight:</div>
  <div class="i0">Some have their veins so drossy, as from earth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their muses only seem to have ta'en their birth.</div>
  <div class="i0">Other but water-poets are, have gone</div>
  <div class="i0">No farther than to the fount of Helicon:</div>
  <div class="i0">And they're but airy ones, whose muse soars up</div>
  <div class="i0">No higher than to mount Parnassus top;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst thou, with thine, dost seem to have mounted higher</div>
  <div class="i0">Than he who fetch from heaven celestial fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">And dost as far surpass all others, as</div>
  <div class="i0">Fire does all other elements surpass.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Flecknoe's memory being only preserved by this satire, his very
name came to be identified with its title. King, in "A Dialogue
in the Shades," introduces him under the name of <em>Mac</em>-Flecknoe;
and Derrick falls into the same error.</p>

<p>Thomas Shadwell was born at Santon-hall, in Norfolk, in
which county his father represented a very ancient family. He
was educated at Caius College, in Cambridge, and placed in the
Middle Temple to study law; but, like many of the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
these buildings, he preferred the smoother paths of literature. He
made several essays in heroic verse, all of which are deplorably
bad. They are chiefly occasional pieces; as, an Address to the
Prince of Orange on his Landing, another to Queen Mary, and
a Translation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal; which, though prefaced
by a violent refutation of our author's attacks upon him, is
so execrable, as fully to confirm Dryden's censures of the author's
poetical talents. But, in comedy, he was much more successful;
and, in that capacity, Dryden does him great injustice in pronouncing
him a dunce. On the contrary, I think most of Shadwell's
comedies may be read with great pleasure. They do not, indeed,
exhibit any brilliancy of wit, or ingenuity of intrigue; but the characters
are truly dramatic, original, and well drawn; and the picture
of manners which they exhibit gives us a lively idea of those
of the author's age. As Shadwell proposed Jonson for his model,
peculiarity of character, or what was then technically called
<em>humour</em>, was what he chiefly wished to exhibit; and in this, it
cannot be denied that he has often succeeded admirably. His
powers, as a dramatist, are highly rated by Rochester, who imputes
his coarseness to rapidity of composition:</p>

</div>

<p>Shadwell's plays are seventeen in number, and were published,
in four volumes, under the inspection of his son, Sir John Shadwell,
M. D.</p>

<p>Shadwell's life was chequered with misfortune. As he espoused
the party of the Duke of Monmouth, to whom he dedicated
"Psyche," and of Shaftesbury, he thought himself obliged to
draw the quill in defence of their cause. Accordingly, as we have
seen, he attempted to answer "The Medal" on the one hand, and,
on the other, accused our author of intending a parallel between
Monmouth and the Duke of Guise, in the play so entitled. This
zeal seems to have cost Shadwell dear; for, besides undergoing the
severe flagellations administered by Dryden, in the "Defence of
the Duke of Guise," in "Absalom and Achitophel," and in the
present poem, he complains, that his ruin was designed, and his life
sought; and that, for near ten years, he was kept from the exercise
of that profession which had afforded him a competent subsistence.<a name="FNanchor_446_447" id="FNanchor_446_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_447" class="fnanchor">[446]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
It is no wonder, therefore, he was among the first to
hail the dawn of the Revolution, by the address already mentioned,
of which the full title is, "A Congratulatory Poem on his
Highness the Prince of Orange his coming into England. Written
by T. S. (Thomas Shadwell,) a True Lover of his Country,
(10th January) 1689;" and that King William distinguished him
by the honours of the laurel. Dorset, who was high chamberlain,
answered, to those who remonstrated on Shadwell's lack of
poetical talent, that, without pretending to vouch for Mr Shadwell's
genius, he was sure he was an honest man. Shadwell did
not long enjoy this triumph over his great enemy. He died 19th
November, 1692,<a name="FNanchor_447_448" id="FNanchor_447_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_448" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> in the fifty-second year of his age. It is said,
this event was hastened by his taking an over dose of opium, to
the use of which he was inordinately addicted. "His death,"
says Dr Nicholas Brady, who preached his funeral sermon,
"seized him suddenly; but he could not be unprepared, since, to
my certain knowledge, he never took a dose of opium but he solemnly
recommended himself to God by prayer." In person,
Shadwell was large, corpulent, and unwieldy; a circumstance
which our author generally keeps in the eye of the reader.
He seems to have imitated his prototype, Ben Jonson, in gross
and coarse sensual indulgence, and profane conversation. But,
if there be truth in a funeral sermon, he must have corrected
these habits before his death; for Dr Brady tells us, "that
our author was a man of great honesty and integrity, and inviolable
fidelity and strictness in his word; an unalterable friendship
wherever he professed it; and however the world may be mistaken
in him, he had a much deeper sense of religion than many who pretended
more to it. His natural and acquired abilities," continues
the Doctor, "made him very amiable to all who knew and conversed
with him, a very few being equal in the becoming qualities
which adorn and set off a complete gentleman; his very enemies,
if he has now any left, will give him this character, at least if
they knew him so thoroughly as I did."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cibber's</span> <cite>Lives of the

<p>Voluminous dramatic authors, who flourished in the beginning
of the 17th century. There were no less than four Heywoods
who wrote plays; so that, Winstanley says, the name of Heywood
seemed to be destinated to the stage. But he whom Dryden here
means, is Thomas Heywood, a person rather to be admired for
the facility, than for the excellence of his compositions. Every
place and situation was alike to him while composing; and the
favourite register of his scenes was the back of a tavern bill. Far
the greater part of his labours are now lost; and yet there remain,
in the libraries of the curious, twenty-four printed plays by
Thomas Heywood. He was an actor by profession, and a good
scholar, as is evinced by several of his classical allusions. His
plays may be examined with advantage by the antiquary, but afford
slender amusement to the lovers of poetry. The following
character of him, by an old poet, is preserved by Langbaine:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Heywood sage,</div>
  <div class="i0">The apologetic Atlas of the stage;</div>
  <div class="i0">Well of the golden age he could entreat,</div>
  <div class="i0">But little of the metal he could get.</div>
  <div class="i0">Threescore sweet babes be fashioned at a lump,</div>
  <div class="i0">For he was christened in Parnassus pump,</div>
  <div class="i0">The muses' gossip to Aurora's bed;</div>
  <div class="i0">And ever since that time his face was red.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we cannot call Heywood a second Lope de Vega, in point of
the extent of his dramatic works, he overtops most English authors;
since he assures us, in his preface to the "English Traveller,"
that it was one reserved among two hundred and twenty
plays, in which he had either had "a whole hand, or, at the least,
a main finger." It is a pity, as Johnson said of Churchill, so
fruitful a tree should have borne only crabs.</p>

<p>James Shirley, whom our author most unjustly couples with
Heywood, to whom, as well as to Shadwell, he was greatly superior,
was born in 1594, and, although for some time a schoolmaster,
appears to have lived chiefly by the stage. When the civil
wars broke out, he followed the fortune of William, Earl of
Newcastle. During the usurpation, when theatres were prohibited,
he returned to his original profession of a schoolmaster.
He died of fatigue and distress of mind during the great fire of
London, in 1666. He wrote forty-two plays, and there are thirty-nine
in print; a complete set of which is much esteemed by collectors.
Dr Farmer has traced, to this neglected bard, an idea,
which Milton thought not unworthy of adoption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Shirley is spoken of with contempt in "Mac-Flecknoe," but
his imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordinary degree. I
recollect a passage in the Fourth Book of the "Paradise Lost,"
which hath been suspected of imitation, as a prettiness below the
genius of Milton: I mean, where Uriel glides backward and forward
to heaven on a sun-beam. Dr Newton informs us, that this
might possibly be hinted by a picture of Annabal Caracci, in the
king of France's cabinet; but I am apt to believe, that Milton
had been struck with a portrait in Shirley. Fernando, in the comedy
of the "Brothers," 1652, describes Jacinta at vespers:</p>

<p>This stuff appears to have been sacred to the use of the poorer

<p>I confess myself, after some research, at a loss to discover the
nature of the procession, in which Shadwell seems to have acted
as leader of the band. One is at first sight led to consider the
whole procession as imaginary, and preliminary to his supposed
coronation; but, on closer investigation, it appears, that Flecknoe
talks of some real occurrence, on which Shadwell preceded the
royal barge, at the head of a boat-load of performers. We may
see, in the seventh note, that he professed to understand music,
and may certainly have been called upon to assist or direct the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
band during some entertainment upon the river, an amusement

<p>This seems to be in ridicule of the following elegant expression
which Shadwell puts in the mouth of a fine lady: "Such a fellow
as he deserves to be <em>tossed in a blanket</em>." This, however, does
not occur in "Epsom-Wells," but in another of Shadwell's comedies,
called "The Sullen Lovers."</p>

<p>Shadwell appears to have been a proficient in music, and to
have himself adjusted that of his opera of "Psyche," which Dryden
here treats with such consummate contempt. Indeed, in the
preface of that choice piece he affected to value himself more upon
the music than the poetry, as appears from the following passage
in the preface: "I had rather be author of one scene of comedy,
like some of Ben Jonson's, than of all the best plays of this kind,
that have been, or ever shall be written; good comedy requiring
much more wit and judgment in the writer, than any rhiming, unnatural
plays can do. This I have so little valued, that I have
not altered six lines in it since it was first written, which (except
the songs at the marriage of Psyche, in the last scene) was all
done sixteen months since. In all the words which are sung, I
did not so much take care of the wit or fancy of them, as the
making of them proper for music; in which I cannot but have
some little knowledge, having been bred, for many years of my
youth, to some performance in it.</p>

<p>"I chalked out the way to the composer, (in all but the song
of Furies and Devils, in the fifth act,) having designed which line I
would have sung by one, which by two, which by three, which by
four voices, &amp;c. and what manner of humour I would have in all
the vocal music."</p>

<p>This unfortunate opera was imitated from the French of Moliere,
and finished, as Shadwell assures us, in the space of five
weeks. The author having no talents for poetry, and no ear for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
versification, "Psyche" is one of the most contemptible of the
frivolous dramatic class to which it belongs. It was, however, <em>got
up</em> with extreme magnificence, and received much applause on its
first appearance, in 1675. To justify the censure of Dryden, it is
only necessary to quote a few of the verses, taken at random as a
specimen, of what he afterwards calls "Prince Nicander's vein:"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i class="personae">Nicander.</i> Madam, I to this solitude am come,</div>
  <div class="i5">Humbly from you to hear my latest doom.</div>

  <div class="i5">How long of scorn and cruelty complain?</div>
  <div class="i6">Your eyes enough have wounded me,</div>
  <div class="i6">You need not add your cruelty.</div>
  <div class="i5">You against me too many weapons chuse,</div>
  <div class="i5">Who am defenceless against each you use.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet himself seems so conscious of the sad inferiority of
his verses, that he makes, in the preface, a half apology, implying
a mortifying consciousness, that it was necessary to anticipate
condemnation, by pleading guilty. "In a thing written
in five weeks, as this was, there must needs be many errors,
which I desire true critics to pass by; and which, perhaps, I
see myself, but having much business, and indulging myself with
some pleasure too, I have not had leisure to mend them; nor
would it indeed be worth the pains, since there are so many splendid
objects in the play, and such variety of diversion, as will not
give the audience leave to mind the writing; and I doubt not but
the candid reader will forgive the faults, when he considers, that
the great design was to entertain the town with variety of music,
curious dancing, splendid scenes, and machines; and that I do
not, nor ever did intend, to value myself upon the writing of this
play."</p>

<p>Shadwell, however, had no right to plead, that this affected
contempt of his own lyric poetry ought to have disarmed the criticism
of Dryden; because, in the very same preface, he sets out
by insinuating, that he could easily have beaten our author on
his own strong ground of rhyme, had he thought such a contest
worth winning. So much, at least, may be inferred from the
following declaration:</p>

<p>"In a good-natured country, I doubt not but this, my first
essay in rhyme, would be at least forgiven, especially when I promise
to offend no more in this kind; but I am sensible that here I
must encounter a great many difficulties. In the first place,
(though I expect more candour from the best writers in rhyme,)
the more moderate of them (who have yet a numerous party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
good judges being very scarce) are very much offended with me,
for leaving my own province of comedy, to invade their dominion
of rhyme: but, methinks, they might be satisfied, since I have
made but a small incursion, and am resolved to retire. And, were
I never so powerful, they should escape me, as the northern people
did the Romans; their craggy barren territories being not worth
conquering."</p>

<p>The combination of the lute and sword, which Dryden alludes
to, is ridiculed in "The Rehearsal," where Bayes informs his critical
friends, that his whole battle is to be represented by two persons;
"for I make 'em both come forth in armour cap-a-pee,
with their swords drawn, and hung with a scarlet ribband at their
wrists, (which, you know, represents fighting enough,) each of
them holding a lute in his hand.&mdash;<cite>Smith.</cite> How, sir; instead of a
buckler?&mdash;<cite>Bayes.</cite> O Lord, O Lord! instead of a buckler! Pray,
sir, do you ask no more questions. I make 'em, sir, play the
battle in <em>recitativo</em>; and here's the conceit: Just at the very same
instant that one sings, the other, sir, recovers you his sword, and
puts himself into a warlike posture; so that you have at once
your ear entertained with music and good language, and your eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
satisfied with the garb and accoutrements of war."&mdash;<cite>Rehearsal</cite>,
Act V. The adverse generals enter accordingly, and perform a
sort of duet, great part of which is a parody upon the lyrical
dialogue of Villerius and the Soldan Solyman, in the "Siege of
Rhodes."</p>

<p>Decker, who did not altogether deserve the disgraceful classification
which Dryden has here assigned to him, was a writer of the
reign of James I., and the antagonist of Jonson. I suspect Dryden
knew, or at least recollected, little more of him, than that he
was ridiculed, by his more renowned adversary, under the character
of Crispinus, in "The Poetaster." Indeed, nothing can
be more unfortunate to an inferior wit, than to be engaged in
controversy with an author of established reputation; since,
though he may maintain his ground with his contemporaries,
posterity will always judge of him by the character assigned
in the writings of his antagonist. Decker was admitted to write
in conjunction with Webster, Ford, Brome, and even Massinger;
and though he was only employed to fill up the inferior scenes, he
certainly displays some theatrical talent. Indeed he was judged,
by many of his own time, to have retaliated Jonson's satire with
success, in "The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet;" where Ben
is designed under the character of Horace Junior. Besides,
Decker possessed some tragic powers: "The Honest Whore,"
which is altogether his own production, has several scenes of
great merit.</p>

<p>Shadwell translated, or rather imitated, Moliere's "L'Avare,"
under the title of "The Miser." In Langbaine's opinion, he has
greatly improved upon his original; but in this, as in other cases,
the critic is probably singular. "The Miser" was printed in
1672.</p>

<p>"The Humorists" was a play professedly written to expose
the reigning vices of the age; but as it was supposed to contain
many direct personal allusions, it was unfavourably received by
the audience. Shadwell, by way, I suppose, of insinuating to
the readers an accurate notion of the characters, or humours,
which he means to represent, is, in this and other pieces, at great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
pains to give a long and minute account of each individual in the
<em>dramatis personæ</em>. Thus we have have in "The Humorists,"</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Crazy,</i>&mdash;One that is in pox, in debt, and all the misfortunes
that can be; and, in the midst of all, in love with most women,
and thinks most women in love with him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Drybob,</i>&mdash;A fantastic coxcomb, that makes it his business to
speak fine things and wit, as he thinks; and always takes notice,
or makes others take notice, of any thing he thinks well said.</p>

<p><i class="personae">"Brisk,</i>&mdash;A brisk, airy, fantastic, singing, dancing coxcomb,
that sets up for a well-bred man, and a man of honour; but mistakes
in every thing, and values himself only upon the vanity and
foppery of gentlemen."</p>

<p>I do not know what to make of the "Hypocrites." Shadwell
wrote no play so entitled; nor is it likely he gave any assistance to
Medbourne, who translated the famous "Tartuffe" of Moliere, for
they were of different opinions in religion and politics. Perhaps
Dryden means the characters of the Irish priest and Tory chaplain
in "The Lancashire Witches."</p>

<p>Raymond is a character in "The Humorists," described in the
<em>dramatis personæ</em> as a "gentleman of wit and honour." Bruce
a similar person in "The Virtuoso," characterized as a "gentleman
of wit and sense." In these, and in all other characters
where wit and an easy style were requisite, Shadwell failed totally.
His forte lay in broad, strong comic painting.</p>

<p>This gentleman, whose name, thanks to our author and Pope,
has become almost proverbial for a bad poet, was originally a
Scottish dancing-master, when probably Scottish dancing was not
so fashionable as at present, and afterwards master of the revels
in Ireland. He translated "The Iliad," "The Odyssey," "The
Æneid," and "Æsop's Fables," into verse; and his versions were
splendidly adorned with sculpture. He also wrote three epic
poems, one of which was fortunately burned in the fire of London.
Moreover, he conducted the ceremony of Charles the Second's coronation,<a name="FNanchor_448_449" id="FNanchor_448_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_449" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>

"For the plot, it is neat and handsome, and the language soft
and gentle, suitable to the persons who speak; neither on the
ground, nor in the clouds, but just like the stage, somewhat elevated
above the common. In neither no stiffness, and, I hope, no
impertinence nor extravagance, into which your young writers

<p>Shadwell's comedy called "The Virtuoso," was first acted in
1676 with great applause. It is by no means destitute of merit;
though, as in all his other pieces, it is to be found rather in the
walk of coarse humour than of elegance, or wit.</p>

<p>The character of Sir Nicholas Gimcrack, the Virtuoso, whose
time was spent in discoveries, although he had never invented any
thing so useful as an engine to pare a cream cheese with, is very
ludicrous. I cannot, however, but notice, that some of the discoveries,
which are ridiculed with so much humour, as the composition
of various kinds of air, for example, have been realized by the
philosophers of this age. As the whole piece seems intended as a
satire on the researches of the Royal Society, its scope could not
be very pleasing to Dryden, a zealous member of that learned
body; even if he could have forgiven some hits levelled against
him personally in the preface and the epilogue, which have been
quoted in the introduction to Mac-Flecknoe.</p>

<p>The plays of Sir George Etherege were much admired during
the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century, till the refinement
of taste condemned their indecency and immorality. Sir
George himself was a courtier of the first rank in the gay court
of Charles II. Our author has addressed an epistle to him, when
he was Resident at Ratisbon. Etherege followed King James to
France, according to one account; but others say he was killed
at Ratisbon by a fall down stairs, after he had been drinking freely.
Sir Fopling Flutter, Dorimant, and Loveit, are characters in
his well-known comedy, "The Man of Mode." Cully and Cockwood
occur in "Love in a Tub," another of his plays.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first edition bears Sydney, which is evidently a mistake.
Shadwell's comedy of "Epsom Wells" was very successful; which
was imputed by his enemies to the assistance he received from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
the witty Sir Charles Sedley. This he attempts to refute in the
following lines of the second prologue, spoken when the piece was
represented before the king and queen at Whitehall:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">If this for him had been by others done,</div>
  <div class="i0">After this honour sure they'd claim their own.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is nevertheless certain, that Shadwell acknowledges obligations
of the nature supposed, in the Dedication of the "True
Widow" to Sir Charles Sedley. "No success whatever," he there
says, "could have made me alter my opinion of this comedy,
which had the benefit of your correction and alteration, and the
honour of your approbation. And I heartily wish you had given
yourself the trouble to have reviewed all my plays, as they came
inaccurately, and in haste, from my hands: it would have been
more to my advantage than the assistance of Scipio and Lelius was
to Terence; and I should have thought it at least as much to my
honour, since, by the effects, I find I cannot but esteem you as
much above both of them in wit, as either of them was above you
in place of the state."</p>

<p>There was a general opinion current, that Shadwell received assistance
in his most successful pieces. A libel of the times, the reference
to which I have mislaid, mentions with contempt the dulness
of his "unassisted scenes."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Sir Formal Trifle is a florid conceited orator in "The Virtuoso,"
whose character is drawn and brought out with no inconsiderable
portion of humour. Dryden intimates, that his coxcomical inflated
style attends Shadwell himself upon the most serious occasions,
and particularly in his dedications to the Duke and Duchess
of Newcastle, to whom he has inscribed several of his plays. Hence
Dryden, in the "Vindication of the Duke of Guise," calls him
the Northern Dedicator. The truth is, that Shadwell's prose was
inflated and embarrassed; and his adulation comes aukwardly
from him, as appears from the opening of the dedication of that
very play, "The Virtuoso," to the Duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p>"So long as your grace persists in obliging, I must go on in acknowledging;
nor can I let any opportunity pass of telling the

</div>
</div>

<p>Shadwell, as appears from many passages of his prologues and
prefaces, and as we have had repeated occasion to notice, affected
to consider Ben Jonson as the object of his emulation. There
were indeed many points of resemblance between them, both as
authors and men. In their habits, a life spent in taverns, and
in their persons, huge corpulence, probably acquired by habits of
sensual indulgence, much coarseness of manners, and an ungentlemanly
vulgarity of dialect, seem to have distinguished both the
original and the imitator. As a dramatist, although Shadwell falls
short of the learned vigour and deep erudition of Ben Jonson, his
dry hard comic painting entitles him to be considered as an inferior
artist of the same school. Dryden more particularly resented
Shadwell's reiterated and affected praises of Jonson, because he
had himself censured that writer in the epilogue to the "Conquest
of Granada," and in the critical defence of that poem.<a name="FNanchor_449_450" id="FNanchor_449_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_450" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Hence
he considered Shadwell's ranking himself under Jonson's banners
as a sort of personal defiance. But Dryden more particularly alludes
to the following ebullition of admiration, which occurs in the
epilogue to Shadwell's "Humorists:"</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i0">The mighty prince of poets, learned Ben,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who alone dived into the minds of men;</div>

  <div class="i0">And all their vain fantastic passions drew</div>
  <div class="i0">In images so lively and so true,</div>
  <div class="i0">That there each humorist himself might view.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet only lashed the errors of the times,</div>
  <div class="i0">And ne'er exposed the persons, but the crimes;</div>
  <div class="i0">And never cared for private frowns, when he</div>

  <div class="i0">He feared no pimp, no pick-pocket, or drab;</div>
  <div class="i0">He feared no bravo, nor no ruffian's stab:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas he alone true humours understood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with great wit and judgment made them good.</div>
  <div class="i0">A humour is the bias of the mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">By which with violence 'tis one way inclined;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">It makes our actions lean on one side still,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in all changes that way bends the will.</div>
  <div class="i0">This&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">He only knew and represented right.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus none, but mighty Jonson, e'er could write.</div>
  <div class="i0">Expect not then, since that most flourishing age</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Ben, to see true humour on the stage.</div>
  <div class="i0">All that have since been writ, if they be scanned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are but faint copies from that master's hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our poet now, amongst those petty things,</div>
  <div class="i0">Alas! his too weak trifling humour brings;</div>
  <div class="i0">As much beneath the worst in Jonson's plays,</div>
  <div class="i0">As his great merit is above our praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">For could he imitate that great author right,</div>
  <div class="i0">He would with ease all poets else outwrite.</div>
  <div class="i0">But to outgo all other men, would be,</div>
  <div class="i0">O noble Ben! less than to follow thee.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dryden, in the text, turns the idea of bias into ridicule; for its
original application being to the leaden weight disposed in the
centre of a bowl, which inclines its course in rolling, he alleges,
that the only bias which can influence Shadwell is his predominant
stupidity.</p>

<p>Among other efforts of gentle dulness, may be noticed the singular
fashion which prevailed during the earlier period of the 17th
century, of writing in such changes of measure, that by the different
length and arrangement of the lines, the poem was made to resemble
an egg, an altar, a pair of wings, a cross, or some other
fanciful figure. This laborious kind of trifling was much akin to
the anagrams and acrostics. Those who are curious to read, or
rather to see, a specimen of such whimsies, (for they are rather addressed
to the eye than the understanding,) may find a dirge of
Mr George Withers, arranged into the figure of a rhomboid, in
Ellis's "Specimens of the Early English Poets," Vol. III. p. 100.
They are mentioned with anagrams, acrostics, rebuses, and other
exercises of false wit, in the "Spectator," No. 63.</p>

match him; for indeed I never, in my slender province, met any that was
worthy to compare to him, unless that unknown, but supposed worthy author,
that writ to him upon his at last turning Roman Catholic; for Bayes,
like the Vicar of Bray, in Henry VIII. Edward VI. Queen Mary, and Queen
Elizabeth's times, was resolved to keep his place; (and the quoting an author
to the purpose, is the same thing, the learned say, as if it was his own), and

the Christian church. The former was patriarch of Alexandria,
and the latter bishop of Nicomedia, in Asia. The dispute regarded
the godhead of the Trinity. The doctrine of Arius, that
God the Son was not co-existent, consequently, not equal in
dignity with God the Father, was condemned by the grand general
council of Nice, and he was banished. But he was afterwards
recalled by the emperor; and his heresy spread so widely, that almost
all the Christian world were at one time Arians. As a test
of the true orthodox doctrine, Athanasius composed the creed
which goes by his name. Being written expressly for this purpose,
and for the exclusive use of the Christian world, Dryden argues,
with great apparent justice, that the anathema with which it
is fenced, has no relation to the heathens, and that we cannot, with
charity, or even logically, argue from thence concerning their
state in the next world.</p></div>

of York, and in high favour with his master. With the intriguing
spirit of a courtier, and the zeal of a Catholic, he had long carried
on a correspondence with Father La Chaise, confessor to the
king of France, with the Pope's nuncio, and with other Catholics
abroad, for the purpose, as he himself states it, of "the
conversion of three kingdoms, and by that, perhaps, the utter subduing
of a pestilent heresy, which has a long time domineered
over a great part of the northern world." It would seem, from
these letters, that it was the purpose of the Catholics, to begin
by obtaining, if possible, a toleration, or exemption from the penal
laws; and then, while strengthening themselves by new converts,
to await the succession of James, or the open declaration of Charles
in favour of their religion. From various points it appears, that
Coleman was a better Catholic than an Englishman; and would
not have hesitated to sacrifice the interests of his country to France,
if, by so doing, he could have brought her faith nearer to Rome.
There were also indications of both the king's and duke's accessibility
to foreign influence, which were fraught with consequences
highly dangerous to the country. But, while the Catholics were
availing themselves of these unworthy dispositions in the royal
brothers, it was quite absurd to suppose, that they should have forfeited
every prospect of success, by assassinating these very persons,
upon whose lives their whole plan depended, to place
upon the throne the Prince of Orange, the head of the Protestant
League. Yet, although not the least trace is to be found in Coleman's
letters of the murders, invasions, fires, and massacres,
which Oates and Bedloe bore witness to, the real and imaginary
conspiracy were identified by the general prepossession of the nation;
and Coleman, who undoubtedly deserved death for his unlawful
and treasonable trafficking with foreign interests against
the religion and liberty of his country, actually suffered for a plot
which was totally chimerical.</p></div>

the year 1580, obtained a bull from the Pope, declaring, that the
previous bull of Pius V., deposing and excommunicating Queen
Elizabeth, did forever bind the heretics, but not the Catholics,
till a favourable opportunity should occur of putting it into execution.
Thus armed, they came into England, their native country,
for the express purpose of proclaiming the pope's right to dethrone
monarchs, and that Queen Elizabeth's subjects were freed
from their allegiance. Campian was hanged for preaching this
doctrine, A. D. 1581. Parsons, finding England too hot for him,
fled beyond seas, and settled at Rome. He published many works,
both in English and Latin, against the church and state of England;
one of which is, "A Conference about the next Succession
of the Crown of England." printed in 1593, under the name of N.
Doleman. The first part contains the doctrine concerning the
right of the church to chastise kings, and proceed against them.
This book the fanatics found so much to their purpose, that they
reprinted it, to justify the murder of Charles I.&mdash;<cite>Athenæ Oxon.</cite>

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The passage in Lord Herbert's history, referred to by Dryden,
seems to be that which follows:
</p>
<p>
"For as the scriptures began then commonly to be read, so
out of the literal sense thereof, the manner of those times was,
promiscuously to draw arguments, for whatsoever in matter of
state or otherwise was to be done. Insomuch, that the text which
came nearest the point in question, was taken as a decision of the
business; to the no little detriment of their affairs: The scriptures
not pretending yet to give regular instructions in those points.
But this is so much less strange, that the year preceding, the
Scriptures (heretofore not permitted to the view of the people)
were now translated in divers languages, and into English, by
Tindal, Joy, and others, though, as not being warranted by the
king's authority, they were publickly burnt, and a new and better
translation promised to be set forth, and allowed to the people.
It being not thought fit by our king, that under what pretence or
difficulty soever, his subjects should be defrauded of that, wherein
was to be found the word of God, and means of their salvation.
Howbeit not a few inconveniences were observed to follow. For
as the people did not sufficiently separate the more clear and necessary
parts thereof, from the obscure and accessory; and as
again taking the several authors to be equally inspired, they did
equally apply themselves to all; they fell into many dangerous
opinions: Little caring how they lived, so they understood well,
bringing religion thus into much irresolution and controversie,
while few men agreeing on the same interpretation of the harder
places, vexed each others conscience, appropriating to themselves
the gift of the spirit. Whereof the Roman church, (much perplext
at first with these defections) did at last avail itself; as
assuming alone the power of that decision, which yet was used
more in favour of themselves, than such an analogy, as ought to
be found in so perfect a book. So that few were satisfied therewith,
but such as, renouncing their own judgment, and submitting
to theirs, yielded themselves wholly to an implicit faith; in which,
though they found an apparent ease, yet as, for justifying of themselves,
the authority of their belief was derived more immediately
from the church, than the scripture, not a few difficulties were
introduced, concerning both: While the more speculative sort
could not imagine, how to hold that as an infallible rule, which
needed humane help to vindicate and support it; nevertheless, as
by frequent reading of the scripture at this time, it generally appeared
what the Roman church had added or altered in religion,
so many recovered a just liberty, endeavouring together a reformation
of the doctrine and manners of the clergy, which yet,
through the obstinacy of some, succeeded worse, than so pious
intentions deserved."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> William Tyndal, otherwise called Hitchens, was born on the
borders of Wales, and educated at Oxford. He was one of the
earliest Protestants, and so boldly maintained the doctrines of the
Reformation, that he was obliged to leave England. He employed
himself, while abroad, in executing a translation, first of the
New Testament, and afterwards of the Pentateuch, with prologues
to the different books. But as he was a zealous Lutheran, and as it
had not pleased King Henry VIII. that his subjects should become
Protestants, though they had ceased to be Papists, Tyndal's version
of the New Testament was publickly burned, and prohibited by royal
proclamation, as tending to disturb the brains of weak persons. This
grossly indecorous expression was not altogether without foundation.
A rule of faith, containing the most sublime doctrines both of faith
and moral practice, and which had long been acknowledged the
only guide to heaven, could not be exposed at once to the vulgar,
who had been bred up in the grossest ignorance of its nature and
contents, without dazzling and confounding them, as the beams of
the sun suddenly let in upon the inmates of an obscure dungeon.
It was not till the sacred Scriptures, with the expositions of judicious
pastors, became a part of the regular education of the people,
that their minds were duly prepared to make the proper
use of that inestimable gift.
</p>
<p>
The fate of Tyndal was melancholy enough. By the influence
of Henry, he was seized at Brussels; and, under pretence of his
being a pragmatical incendiary, one of the first translators of the
New Testament was strangled and burned, at Filford castle, about
twenty miles from Antwerp, in 1536. His last words were,
"Lord, open the king of England's eyes."</p></div>

public liturgy, confirmed by act of parliament in the second and
third years of Edward VI., "if Calvin's pragmatical spirit had
not interposed. He first began to quarrel at some passages in this
sacred liturgy, and afterwards never left soliciting the lord protector,
and practising, by his agents, on the court, the country,
and the universities, till he had laid the first foundation of the
Zuinglian faction, who laboured nothing more than innovation
both in doctrine and discipline."&mdash;<cite>Ecclesia Restaurata.</cite> Address

Ecclesiastical Policy, in which he vindicates that communion,
both against the Puritans and Papists. It is in eight books; five
were published during Hooker's lifetime, and the other three after
his death. The last are supposed to be interpolated, as they
bear some passages tending to impugn the doctrine of non-resistance,
which at that time was a shibboleth of orthodoxy. Hooker
died in 1600. His Life, to which Dryden refers, was written by
the worthy Isaac Walton, better known as the author of the
"Complete Angler;" a delightful work, where the innocent simplicity,
unclouded cheerfulness, and real worth of the author,
beam through every page. His Life of Hooker was published
about 1662. See <span class="smcap">Hawkin's</span> edition of the <cite>Complete Angler</cite>, Introduction,

became secretary to Lord Mountjoy, Lieutenant of Ireland.
On the 13th November, 1600, Cranmer was slain in a
skirmish at Carlingford between the English and the forces of
Tyrone. Camden thus records his death: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cecidit tamen ex Anglis,

Mar-prelate, or Mar-priest, as having been a plague to the
bishops and clergy of his time. He was a native of Wales, and
originally a sub-sizer of Peter-house, in Cambridge. Afterwards
he obtained the degree of Master of Arts in Oxford, and, having
taken orders, was for some time a regular clergyman. But
being a person "full of Welch blood, of a hot and restless
head," Anthony Wood tells us, he became a furious Anabaptist,
and the most bitter enemy to the church of England that appeared
in the long reign of Queen Elizabeth. He wrote a great number
of <em>pestilent</em> pamphlets, with burlesque titles; such as, "Oh, read
over John Bridges, for it is a worthy work. Printed over sea, in
Europe, within two furlongs of a bouncing Priest, at the cost of
Martin Mar-prelate, gent." All his writings were filled with the
most virulent invectives against the Episcopal church. At length,
being apprehended, and tried for writing and publishing infamous
books and libels against the established religion, he was condemned
and executed at St Thomas a Watering, 29th May, 1593.
Dryden compares him to Andrew Marvel, the well known opposer
of the court, during the reign of Charles II.</p></div>

presbyterians and the non-conformists in general, the anti-monarchical
principles of the fanatics, who brought Charles I. to the
scaffold. Their arguments may be seen at length in a book entitled,
"Seditious Teachers, ungodly Preachers exemplified." These
charges are carried too far; yet as the Episcopalians made church
and king their watchword, the fanatics, on the contrary, in England,
and the Huguenots in France, had a certain tendency to oppose
monarchical government. One of their authors, as early as the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, maintains, that if kings and princes refused
to reform religion, the inferior magistrates or people, by direction
of the ministry, might lawfully, and ought, if need required, even
by force of arms, to reform it themselves.&mdash;<cite>Whittingham's Preface

histories of the time. Hacket, a man of some learning, had his
brain turned by enthusiasm, and seduced Coppinger and Arthington,
two fanatic preachers, by his example and exhortation, to
sally forth into the streets of London, where he proclaimed himself
to be the Messiah, and Coppinger and Arthington, his prophet
of mercy, and his prophet of judgment. As they continued
to utter the most horrible blasphemies, and to exhort the citizens
to take arms, to further the reign of Hacket, who, they said, was
come with his fan in his hand to purify the discipline of the church
of England, they were seized and lodged in prison. Hacket was
executed, though fitter for Bedlam, persisting to the last in the
most insane blasphemy. The discipline of the prison restored
Arthington to his senses, and he published a recantation, expressing
great remorse for his errors. Coppinger starved himself to
death in jail. This explosion of madness took place in 1591.
Hacket is stated by Camden to have been a determined enemy to
Queen Elizabeth, and to have stabbed her picture with his dagger.</p></div>

been Hampden, son of the famous parliamentary leader, who was
deeply engaged in the Rye-house Plot, and some years afterwards
killed himself. Dryden was not likely, in the very hottest of his
political controversy, to be on very intimate habits with a leader
of the Whigs, much less to inscribe to him a poem, the preface of
which, at least, is levelled against the most zealous of that party.
Besides, the translation of Pere Simon's Critical History, which was
published in 1682, bears to have been made by H. D. which initials
can hardly stand for John Hampden. Mr Malone conjectures
he may have been of the Digby family, or perhaps Mr Dodswell,
who translated one of Plutarch's Lives, But it appears, from
a poem addressed to the Translator by Duke, that his name was
Henry Dickinson, probably a son of Edmund Dickinson, a physician,
and author of the <cite>Delphi Phenecizantes</cite>, and other learned
pieces. <cite>Athenæ Oxon.</cite> Vol. II. p. 946. There is another copy
of verses, addressed to the Translator of the "Critical History"
in Dryden's "Miscellanies." So that Dickinson's work seems to
have attracted much notice at the time of its publication.</p></div>

of persons; being a part of the punishment which he says the
laureat inflicted on Shadwell for presuming to dispute his theatrical
infallibility. "But, gentlemen, when I had thus, in the plenitude
of my power, issued out the above-mentioned decretal epistles,
you cannot imagine what abundance of adversaries I created myself:
some were for appealing to a free unbiassed synod of impartial
authors; others were for suing out a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quo warranto</i>, to examine
the validity of my charter. Not to mention those of higher quality,
I was immediatly set upon by the fierce Elkanah, the Empress
of Morocco's agent, who at that time commanded a party of
Moorish horse, in order to raise the siege of Grenada; and a fat
old gouty gentleman, commonly called the King of Basan, who
had almost devoured the stage with free quarter for his men of
wit and humourists. But I countermined all their designs against
my crown and person in a moment; for I presently got the one to
be dressed up in a sanbenit, under the unsanctified name of
Doeg; the other I coupled myself with his namesake Tom Sternhold.
Being thus degraded from their poetical functions, and
become incapable of crowning princes, raising ghosts, and offering
any more incense of flattery to the living and the dead, I delivered
them over to the secular arm, to be chastised by the furious
dapper-wits of the Inns of Court, and the young critics of the university.
Furthermore, to prevent all infection of their errors, I
directed my monitory letters to the Sieur Batterton, advising him
to keep no correspondence, either directly or indirectly, with
those aforesaid apostates from sense and reason; adding, that in
case of neglect, I would certainly put the theatre under an interdict,
send a troop of dragoons from Drury-Lane to demolish his
garrison in Salisbury-court, and absolve all his subjects, even to
the sub-deacons and acolythes of the stage, his trusty door-keepers
and candle-lighters, from their oaths of fealty and allegiance."

of the fathers: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pantheræ, ut Divus Basilius ait, cum immani sint ac crudeli

fain know how Mr Bayes, that so well understood the nature of beasts, came
to pitch upon the Hind and the Panther, to signify the church of Rome and
the church of England? Doubtless his reply will be, because the hind is a
creature harmless and innocent; the panther mischievous and inexorable.
Let all this be granted; what is this to the author's absurdity in the choice of
his beasts? For the scene of the persecution is Europe, a part of the world
which never bred panthers since the creation of the universe. On the other
side, grant his allusion passable, and then he stigmatizes the church of England
to be the most cruel and most voracious creature that ranges all the Lybian
deserts;&mdash;a character, which shows him to have a strange mist before his
eyes when he reads ecclesiastical history. And then, says he,</p>

<p>Which is another blunder, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cujus contrarium verum est</i>: For if beauty,
strength, and courage, advance the value of the several parts of the creation,
without question the panther is far to be preferred before the hind, a poor,
silly, timorous, ill-shaped, bobtailed creature, of which a score will hardly
purchase the skin of a true panther. Had he looked a little farther, Ludolphus
would have furnished him with a zebra, the most beautiful of all the
four-footed creatures in the world, to have coped with his panther for spots,
and with his hind for gentleness and mildness; of which one was sold singly
to the Turkish governor of Suaquena for 2000 Venetian ducats. There had
been a beast for him, as pat as a pudding for a friar's mouth. But to couple the
hind and the panther was just like <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic magna parvis componere</i>; and, therefore,
he had better have put his hind in a good pasty, or reserved her for some
more proper allusion; for this, though his nimble beast have four feet, will by
no means run <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quatuor pedibus</i>, though she had a whole kennel of hounds at
her heels."&mdash;<cite>The Revolter, a Tragi-comedy.</cite></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The following justification of their plan is taken from the preface, which
is believed to have been entirely the composition of Montague.</p>

<p>"The favourers of 'The Hind and Panther' will be apt to say in its defence,
that the best things are capable of being turned to ridicule; that Homer
has been burlesqued, and Virgil travestied, without suffering any thing in
their reputation from that buffoonery; and that, in like manner,'The Hind
and the Panther' may be an exact poem, though it is the subject of our raillery:
But there is this difference, that those authors are wrested from their
true sense, and this naturally falls into ridicule; there is nothing represented
here as monstrous and unnatural, which is not equally so in the original.&mdash;First,
as to the general design; Is it not as easy to imagine two mice bilking
coachmen, and supping at the Devil, as to suppose a hind entertaining the
panther at a hermit's cell, discussing the greatest mysteries of religion, and
telling you her son Rodriguez writ very good Spanish? What can be more
improbable and contradictory to the rules and examples of all fables, and to
the very design and use of them? They were first begun, and raised to the
highest perfection, in the eastern countries, where they wrote in signs, and
spoke in parables, and delivered the most useful precepts in delightful stories;
which, for their aptness, were entertaining to the most judicious, and led
the vulgar into understanding by surprizing them with their novelty, and fixing
their attention. All their fables carry a double meaning; the story is one
and entire; the characters the same throughout, not broken or changed, and
always conformable to the nature of the creatures they introduce. They never
tell you, that the dog, which snapt at a shadow, lost his troop of horse;
that would be unintelligible; a piece of flesh is proper for him to drop, and
the reader will apply it to mankind: They would not say, that the daw, who
was so proud of her borrowed plumes, looked very ridiculous, when Rodriguez
came and took away all the book but the 17th, 24th, and 25th chapters, which
she stole from him. But this is his new way of telling a story, and confounding
the moral and the fable together.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Before the word was written, said the hind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our Saviour preached the faith to all mankind.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What relation has the hind to our Saviour? or what notion have we of a
panther's bible? If you say he means the church, how does the church feed
on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church, or always the
cloven-footed beast, for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line. If
it is absurd in comedies to make a peasant talk in the strain of a hero, or a
country wench use the language of the court, how monstrous is it to make a
priest of a hind, and a parson of a panther? To bring them in disputing with
all the formalities and terms of the school? Though as to the arguments
themselves, those we confess are suited to the capacity of the beasts; and if
we would suppose a hind expressing herself about these matters, she would
talk at that rate."</p>

<p>The reader may be curious to see a specimen of the manner in which these
two applauded wits encountered Dryden's controversial poem, with such eminent
success, that a contemporary author has said, "that 'The City and
Country Mouse' ruined the reputation of the divine, as the 'Rehearsal'
ruined the reputation of the poet."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The plan is a dialogue between Bayes,
and Smith, and Johnson, his old friends in the "Rehearsal;" the poet
recites to them a new work, in which the Popish and English churches are
represented as the city and country mouse, the former spotted, the latter
milk-white. The following is a specimen both of the poetry and dialogue:</p>

deformed, arrogant nonsense, and self-contradiction, drest up in fine language,
like an ugly brazen-faced whore, peeping through the costly trappings

arrogant, because impertinent: For could Mr Bayes have so little wit, to
think himself a sufficient champion to decide the high mysteries of faith and
transubstantiation, and the nice disputes concerning traditions and infallibility,
in a discourse between "The Hind and the Panther," which, undetermined
hitherto, have exercised all the learning in the world? Or, could he
think the grand arcana of divinity a subject fit to be handled in flourishing
rhyme, by the author of "The Duke of Guise," or "The Conquest of Peru,"
or "The Spanish Friar:" Doubts which Mr Bayes is no more able to unfold,
than Saffold to resolve a question in astrology. And all this only as a tale
to usher in his beloved character, and to shew the excellency of his wit in
abusing honest men. If these were his thoughts, as we cannot rationally
otherwise believe, seeing that no man of understanding will undertake an enterprise,
wherein he does not think himself to have some advantage of his
predecessors; then does this romance, I say, of The Panther and the Hind,
fall under the most fatal censure of unseasonable folly and saucy impertinence.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> The following is the commencement of his "Reflections on the Hind
and Panther," in a letter to a friend, 1687:</p>

<p>"The present you have made me of "The Hind and Panther," is variously
talked of here in the country. Some wonder what kind of champion the
Roman Catholics have now gotten; for they have had divers ways of representing
themselves; but this of rhyming us to death, is altogether new and
unheard of, before Mr Bayes set about it; and, indeed, he hath done it in
the sparkishest poem that ever was seen. 'Tis true, he hath written a great
many things; but he never had such pure swiftness of thought, as in this composition,
nor such fiery flights of fancy. Such hath always been his dramatical
and scenical way of scribbling, that there was no post nor pillar in the
town exempt from the pasting up of the titles of his plays; insomuch, that
the footboys, for want of skill in reading, do now (as we hear) often bring
away, by mistake, the title of a new book against the Church of England,
instead of taking down the play for the afternoon. Yet, if he did it well or
handsomely, he might deserve some pardon; but, alas! how ridiculously
doth he appear in print for any religion, who hath made it his business to
laugh at all! How can he stand up for any mode of worship, who hath been
accustomed to bite, and spit his venom against the very name thereof?</p>

<p>"Wherefore, I cannot but wish our adversaries joy on their new-converted
hero, Mr Bayes; whose principle it is to fight single with whole armies; and
this one quality he prefers before all the moral virtues put together. The
Roman Catholics may talk what they will, of their Bellarmine and Perrone,
their Hector and Achilles, and I know not who; but I desire them all, to
shew one such champion for the cause, as this Drawcansir: For he is the
man that kills whole nations at once; who, as he never wrote any thing, that
any one can imagine has ever been the practice of the world, so, in his late
endeavours to pen controversy, you shall hardly find one word to the purpose.
He is that accomplished person, who loves reasoning so much in
verse, and hath got a knack of writing it smoothly. The subject (he treats of
in this poem) did, in his opinion, require more than ordinary spirit and
flame; therefore, he supposed it to be too great for prose; for he is too proud
to creep servilely after sense; so that, in his verse, he soars high above the
reach of it. To do this, there is no need of brain, 'tis but scanning right; the
labour is in the finger, not in the head.</p>

<p>"However, if Mr Bayes would be pleased to abate a little of the exuberancy
of his fancy and wit; to dispense with his ornaments and superfluencies
of invention and satire, a man might consider, whether he should submit to
his argument; but take away the railing, and no argument remains; so that
one may beat the bush a whole day, and, after so much labour, only spring a
butterfly, or start a hedge-hog.</p>

<p>"For all this, is it not great pity to see a man, in the flower of his romantic
conceptions, in the full vigour of his studies on love and honour, to fall into
such a distraction, as to walk through the thorns and briars of controversy,
unless his confessor hath commanded it, as a penance for some past sins?
that a man, who hath read Don Quixote for the greatest part of his life,
should pretend to interpret the Bible, or trace the footsteps of tradition, even
in the darkest ages?"&mdash;<cite>Four Letters</cite>, &amp;c.</p></div>

poetry, yet others, who have pretended to answer him, wanted the
breeding and civility to do the like: Now, because I would not willingly disoblige
a person of Mr Bayes's character, I do here fairly, and before all the
world, assure him that my name is Dudly Tomkinson, and that I live within
two miles of St Michael's Mount, in Cornwall, and have, in my time, been
both constable, church-warden, and overseer of the parish; by the same token,
that the little gallery next the belfry, the new motto about the pulpit,
the king's arms, the ten commandments, and the great sun-dial in the church-yard,
will transmit my name to all posterity. Furthermore, (if it will do
him any good at all) I can make a pretty shift to read without spectacles;
wear my own hair, which is somewhat inclining to red; have a large mole on
my left cheek; am mightily troubled with corns; and, what is peculiar to my
constitution, after half-a-dozen bottles of claret, which I generally carry
home every night from the tavern, I never fail of a stool or two next morning;
besides, use to smoke a pipe every day after dinner, and afterwards
steal a nap for an hour or two in the old wicker-chair near the oven; take
gentle purgatives spring and fall; and it has been my custom, any time these
sixteen years, (as all the parish can testify) to ride in Gambadoes. Nay, to
win the heart of him for ever, I invite him here, before the courteous reader,
to a country regale, (provided he will before hand promise not to debauch my
wife,) where he shall have sugar to his roast beef, and vinegar to his butter;
and lastly, to make him amends for the tediousness of the journey, a parcel
of relics to carry home with him, which I believe can scarce be matched in
the whole Christian world; but, because I have no great fancy that way, I
don't care if I part with them to so worthy a person; they are as followeth:</p>

<p>"St Gregory's Ritual, bound up in the same calve's-skin that the old
gentleman, in St Luke, roasted at the return of his prodigal son.</p>

<p>"The quadrant that a Philistine tailor took the height of Goliah by, when
he made him his last suit of clothes; for the giant being a man of extraordinary
dimensions, it was impossible to do this in any other way than your designers
use when they take the height of a country-steeple," &amp;c &amp;c..&mdash;<cite>Reasons

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> The tumultuary joy of the sectaries, upon their first view of
this triumph over the church of England, led them into all the extravagancies
of loyalty, which used to be practised by their ancient
enemies the Tories. Addresses teeming with affection, and
foaming with bombast, were poured in upon King James from all
corners of his dominions; Presbyterians, Anabaptists, Quakers,
Sectaries of all sorts and persuasions, strove to be foremost in the
race of gratitude. And when similar addresses came in from corporations,
who had been formerly anxious to shew their loyalty on
the subject of the Rye-house plot, the king's accession, and other
occasions of triumph to the Tories, the tone of these bodies also
was wonderfully changed; and, instead of raving against excluders,
rebels, regicides, republicans, and fanatics, whose hellish contrivances
endeavoured to destroy the safety of the kingdom, and the
life of the king, these same gentlemen mention the Sectaries as
their brethren and fellow-subjects, to whom the king, their common
father, had been justly, liberally, royally pleased to grant
freedom of conscience, for which the addressers offer their hearty
and unfeigned thanks. These were the two classes of persons,
whom Dryden, as they had closed with the measures of government,
declares to be exempted from his satire. Those, therefore,
against whom it is avowedly directed, are first, the Church
of England, whose adherents saw her destruction aimed at through
the pretence of toleration. 2dly, Those Sectaries, who distrusted
the boon which the king presented, and feared that the consequences
of this immediate indulgence at the hands of an ancient
enemy, would be purchased by future persecution. These formed
a body, small at first, but whose numbers daily increased.</p>

<p>Among the numerous addresses which were presented to the
court on this occasion, there are two somewhat remarkable from
the quality and condition of the persons in whose name they are
offered. The one is from the persons engaged in the schemes of
Shaftesbury and Monmouth, and who set out by acknowledging
their lives and fortunes forfeited to King James; a singular instance
of convicts offering their sentiments upon state affairs.
The other is from no less a corporation than the company of London
Cooks, which respectable persons declare their approbation
of the indulgence, upon a principle recognized in their profession,
"the difference of <em>men's gusto</em>, in religion, as in eatables;" and assure
his majesty, that his declaration "somewhat resembles the
Almighty's manna, which suited every man's palate." <cite>History of
Addresses</cite>, pp. 106, 132.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> Most readers will, I think, acknowledge with me, the extreme
awkwardness with which Dryden apologizes, for hoping well of
those Sectaries, against whom he had so often discharged the utmost
severity of his pen. Yet there is much real truth in the observation,
though the compliment to the new allies of the Catholics
is but a cold one. Many sects have distinguished themselves
by faction, fanaticism, and furious excess at their rise, which, when
their spirits have ceased to be agitated by novelty, and exasperated
by persecution, have subsided into quiet orderly classes of citizens,
only remarkable for some peculiarities of speculative doctrine.</p></div>

in and about the city of London, commonly called Presbyterians:
"Your majesty's princely wisdom," say these reverend
sycophants, "now rescues us from our long sufferings, and by the
same royal act restores God to the empire over conscience." This
it is to be too eloquent; when people set no bounds to their rhetoric,
it betrays them often into nonsense, and not seldom into
blasphemy.&mdash;<cite>History of Addresses</cite>, p. 107.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> In his ardour for extending the Catholic religion, James II.
had directed copies of the papers found in his brother's strongbox
in favour of that communion, with the copy of a paper by his
first duchess, giving the reasons for her conversion to that faith,
to be printed, and circulated through the kingdom. These papers
were answered by the learned Stillingfleet, then Dean of St Paul's.
A Defence of the Papers was published "by command," of which
it appears, from the passage in the text, that our author wrote the
third part, which applies to the Duchess of York's paper. Stillingfleet
published a vindication of his answer, in which he attacks
our author with some severity. A full account of the controversy
will be found attached to Dryden's part of the Defence, among his
prose works.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> In the controversy between Dryden and Stillingfleet, the former
had concluded his Defence of the Duchess of York's paper, by
alleging, that "among all the volumes of divinity written by the
Protestants, there is not one original treatise, at least that I have
seen or heard of, which has handled distinctly, and by itself, the
Christian virtue of humility." This Stillingfleet, in his reply, calls
a "bare-faced assertion of a thing known to be false;" for, "with-in
a few years, besides what has been printed formerly, such a book
hath been published in London." Dryden, in the text, replies to
this allegation, that Duncombe's treatise, which he supposes to be
meant, is a translation from the Spanish of Rodriguez, therefore,
not originally a Protestant work. Montague, in the preface to
"The Hind and Panther Transversed" alleges, that Dryden has
mistaken the name of the author of the treatise alluded to; which
was not, he asserts, Duncombe, but Allen. See the matter more
fully canvassed in a note on the original passage, in "The Duchess
of York's Paper Defended."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> Dryden is not quite candid in his statement. In Stillingfleet's
answer to the Duchess's paper, it is indeed called, the "paper
<em>said</em> to be written by a great lady;" but there is not another
word upon the authority, which, indeed, considering it was published
under the king's immediate inspection, could not be very
decorously disputed. Dryden seizes upon this phrase in his defence,
and, coupling with it some expressions of the Bishop of
Winchester, he argues that it was the intention of these sons of
the church of England, to give the lie to their sovereign. In this
vindication of the answer, Stillingfleet thus expresses himself:
"As to the main design of the third paper, I declared, that I considered
it, as it was supposed to contain the reasons and motives
of the conversion of so great a lady to the church of Rome.</p>

<p>"But this gentleman has now eased me of the necessity of farther
considering it on that account. For he declares, that none
of those motives or reasons are to be found in the paper of her
highness. Which he repeats several times. 'She writ this paper,
not as to the reasons she had herself for changing, &amp;c.' 'As
for her reasons, they were only betwixt God and her own soul, and
the priest with whom she spoke at last.'</p>

<p>"And so my work is at an end as to her paper. For I never
intended to ransack the private papers or secret narratives of great
persons; and I do not in the least question the relation now given
from so great authority, as that he mentions of the passages concerning
her; and therefore I have nothing more to say as to what
relates to the person of the duchess."</p>

<p>It is obvious that Dryden, probably finding the divine too hard
for him on the controversial part of the subject, affects to consider
the dispute as entirely limited to the authenticity of the paper,
which it cannot be supposed Stillingfleet ever seriously intended to
impeach.</p></div>

up as a champion for the test, against the repeal which James
had so deeply at heart. This female theologian is mentioned in
the "Remarks from the country, upon the two Letters, relating to
the convocation, and alterations in the liturgy." "It is a thousand
pities, so instructive and so eloquent papers should ever fall
under such an imputation, (of being too forward, and solemn impertinence,)
and be ranked among the scribblings of Eleanor James,
with this only advantage of having better language, whereas the
woman counsellor is judged to have the better meaning." Although
Mrs James's lucubrations were thus vilipended by the male
disputants, one of her own sex thought it necessary to enter the
lists in opposition to her. <cite>See Elizabeth Rone's short Answer to

the German proverb has it, was called into another world at two
o'clock in the night, February 18, 1546." This was one of the

is to say, they believe, that, though the elements are not changed
into the body and blood of Christ by consecration, which is the
Roman faith, yet the participants, at the moment of communicating,
do actually receive the real body and blood. The Calvinists
utterly deny the real presence in the eucharist, and affirm,
that the words of Christ were only symbolical. The church
of England announces a doctrine somewhat between these. See

vigorously carried on by the king and his counsellors, as appears clearly by
the doctrinals in the Book of Homilies, and by the practical part of Christian
piety, in the first public Liturgy, confirmed by act of parliament, in the second
and third year of the king; and in that act (and, which is more, by
Fox himself) affirmed to have been done by the especial aid of the Holy
Ghost. And here the business might have rested, if Catin's pragmatical spirit
had not interposed. He first began to quarrel at some passages in this sacred
liturgy, and afterwards never left soliciting the Lord Protector, and practising
by his agents on the court, the country, and the universities, till he had
laid the first foundation of the Zuinglian faction; who laboured nothing more,
than innovation both in doctrine and discipline; to which they were encouraged
by nothing more than some improvident indulgence granted unto John
A-Lasco; who, bringing with him a mixt multitude of Poles and Germans,
obtained the privilege of a church for himself and his, distinct in government
and forms of worship from the church of England.</p>

<p>"This gave powerful animation to the Zuinglian gospellers, (as they are
called by Bishop Hooper, and some other writers) to practise first upon the
church; who being countenanced, if not headed, by the Earl of Warwick,
(who then began to undermine the Lord Protector,) first quarrelled the episcopal
habit, and afterwards inveighed against caps and surplices, against
gowns and tippets, but fell at last upon the altars, which were left standing
in all churches by the rules of liturgy. The touching on this string made excellent
music to most of the grandees of the court, who had before cast many
an envious eye on those costly hangings, that massy plate, and other rich and
precious utensils, which adorned those altars. And what need all this waste?
said Judas, when one poor chalice only, and perhaps not that, might have
served the turn. Besides, there was no small spoil to be made of copes, in
which the priest officiated at the holy sacrament; some of them being made
of cloth of tissue, of cloth of gold and silver, or embroidered velvet; the
meanest being made of silk, or satin, with some decent trimming. And
might not these be handsomely converted into private use, to serve as carpets
for their tables, coverlids to their beds, or cushions to their chairs or
windows. Thereupon some rude people are encouraged under-hand to beat
down some altars, which makes way for an order of the council-table, to take
down the rest, and set up tables in their places; followed by a commission,
to be executed in all parts of the kingdom, for seizing on the premises to the
use of the king."</p></div>

in England. We teach humanity at Lincoln, Norwich, and York. At Warwick,
we have a public chapel secured from all injuries by the king's soldiers;
we have also bought some houses of the city of Wiggorn, in the province
of Lancaster. The Catholic cause very much increaseth. In some
Catholic churches, upon holidays, above 1500 are always numbered present
at the sermon. At London, likewise, things succeed no worse. Every holiday,
or preaching, people are so frequent, that many of the chapels cannot
contain them. Two of our fathers, Darmes and Berfall, do constantly say
mass before the king and queen. Father Edmund Newill, before the queen-dowager,
Father Alexander Regnes in the chapel of the ambassador aforesaid,
others in other places. Many houses are bought for the college in the
Savoy, as they call it, nigh Somerset-house, London, the palace of the queen-dowager,
to the value of about eighteen thousand florins; in making of
which, after the form of a college, they labour very hard, that the schools
may be opened before Easter." A Letter from a Jesuit at Liege. <cite>Somers'

displeasure of Sir John Reresby, the governor of the city, who had fitted it
up for his own residence. See his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, pp. 245, 246.</p></div>

the delivery of St Margaret, explained to allude to the liberty of conscience
procured by James's abolition of the test and penal laws. These decorations,
remarkable for their import, and the place in which they were exhibited,
were accompanied with the discharge of fire-works, and other public
rejoicings. There are particular accounts of the splendid rejoicings at Ratisbon
and Paris, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the Gazettes of the period.</p></div>

being a sort of cant jargon, not void of low humour:</p>

<p>"<em>Bayes.</em> Now, there being but three remarkable places in the whole island;
that is, the two universities, and the great metropolitan city; I shall, consequently,
confine my discourse only to them: But, first of all, I must tell you,
that I am altogether of my Lord Plausible's opinion in the "Plain Dealer;"
if I chance to commend any place, or order of men, out of pure friendship,
I choose to do it before their faces; and if I have occasion to speak ill of any
person or place, out of a principle of respect and good manners, I do it behind
their backs. You cannot imagine, Mr Crites, when I visit either of the
two universities, in my own person, or by my commissioners of the playhouse,
how much I am taken with a college life: Oh, there's nothing like a
cheese cut out into farthings! and my Lord Mayor, amidst all his brutal city
luxury, does not dine half so well as a student upon a single chop of rotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
roasted mutton; nay, I can scarce prevail with myself, for a month or two
after, to eat my meat on a plate, so great a respect have I for a university
trencher; and then their conversation is so learned, and withal so innocent,
that I could sit a whole day together at a coffee-house to hear them dispute
about <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">actus perspicui</i>, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">forma misti</i>. From this beginning I naturally fall
a railing at London, with as much zeal as a Buckingham-shire grazier, who
had his pocket picked at a Smithfield entertainment; or a country lady, whose
obsequious knight has spent his estate among misses, vintners, and linen-drapers;
and then I tell my audience, that a man may walk farther in the city to
meet a true judge of poetry, than ride his horse on Salisbury Plain to find a
house.</p>

<p>You see here, Mr Crites, that scholars won't take Alderman Duncomb's leaden
halfpence for Irish half crowns, while dull Londoner swallows every thing;
and takes it with as little consideration, as a true Romanist takes a spiritual
dose of relicts, that are sealed up with the council of Trent's coat-of-arms.</p>

<p><em>Eugen.</em> How was that, Mr Bayes, about the council of Trent? Pray, let
us hear it again.</p>

<p><em>Bayes.</em> Gad forgive me for't!&mdash;it dropt from me ere I was aware; but I
shall in time wear off this hitching in my gait, and walk in Catholic trammels
as well as the best of them; nature, I must confess, is not overcome on the
sudden&mdash;But let me see, gentlemen, whether I have any more lines to our
last purpose; oh, here they are!</p>

<p>You are sensible, without question, how little beholden the city is to me,
when I am upon my progress elsewhere. But 'tis a comfort that this peremptory
humour does not continue long upon me; for, as I have the grace to disown

I disown both the sisters, and make myself as merry as a grig, with their greasy
trenchers, rusty salt-sellers, and no napkins, with their everlasting drinking,
and no intervals of fornication to relieve it. In fine, I make a great scruple
of it, whether it be possible for a man to write sound heroics, and make an
accomplished thorough-paced wit, unless he comes to refine and cultivate
himself at London; unless be knows how many stories high the houses are
in Cheapside and Fleet-street; is acquainted with all the gaming ordinaries
about town, and the rates of porters and hackney-coachmen; has shot the
bridge; seen the tombs at Westminster; heard the Wooden-head speak; can
tell you where the insuring-office is kept; and which of the twelve companies</p>

others flying away with a table furnished with fruits, sweetmeats,

that not any succeeding opera could get any money."&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Roscius

his opera of "Psyche," which, with the "Tempest" and other
pieces depending chiefly upon shew and scenery, were acting in
Dorset-Garden, when this Prologue was written. In order to ridicule
these splendid exhibitions, the company at Drury-Lane
brought forward parodies on them, such as the "Mock Tempest,"
"Psyche Debauched," &amp;c. These pieces, though written in the
meanest style by one Duffet, a low buffoon, had a transient course
of success.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_342_343" id="Footnote_342_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_342_343"><span class="label">[342]</span></a> Ralph Bathurst, thus highly distinguished by our author, was
a distinguished character of the age. He was uncle to Allen, the
first Lord Bathurst. He was born in 1620, and bred to the church,
but abandoned divinity for the pursuit of medicine, which he practised
until the Restoration, when he resumed his clerical character.
In 1663 he became head of Trinity college, Oxford, into the court
and chapel of which he introduced the beauties of classical architecture,
to rival, if it were possible, the magnificence of the Gothic
edifices by which it is surrounded. In 1673, he had the honour
to be appointed vice-chancellor; an office which he retained
for two years. During his execution of this duty he is said to
have reformed many abuses which had crept into the university;
and by liberal benefactions added considerably to the prosperity of
literature. Anthony Wood, who had some private reason for disliking
him, and who, moreover, was as determined an enemy to the
fair sex as ever harboured in a cloister, picked a quarrel with
Bathurst's wife, as he could find no reasonable fault with the
vice-chancellor himself. "Dr Bathurst took his place of vice-chancellor;
a man of good parts, and able to do good things;
but he has a wife that scorns that he should be in print; a
scornful woman! scorns that he was dean of Wells: no need of
marrying such a woman, who is so conceited, that she thinks
herself fit to govern a college, or university."&mdash;Perhaps the countenance
given by Bathurst to the theatre, for which Dryden
here expresses his gratitude, might not tend to conciliate the good
will of Anthony, who quarrelled with his sister-in-law by refusing
to treat her to the play. But it agreed well with the character of
Bathurst, who was not only a patron of literature in all its branches,
but himself an excellent Latin poet, as his verses prefixed to
Hobbes' "Leviathan," fully testify; and as good an English poet
as most of his contemporaries. He died in his eighty-fourth year,
1704. Warton has given us the following character of his Latin
compositions, for which Dryden has celebrated him so highly:
"His Latin orations are wonderful specimens of wit and antithesis,
which were the delight of his age. They want, upon the
whole, the purity and simplicity of Tully's eloquence, but even
exceed the sententious smartness of Seneca, and the surprising
turns of Pliny. They are perpetually spirited, and discover an
uncommon quickness of thought. The manner is concise and
abrupt, but yet perspicuous and easy: His allusions are delicate,
and his observations sensible and animated; his sentiments of congratulation,
or indignation, are equally forcible: his compliments
are most elegantly turned, and his satire is most ingeniously severe.
These compositions are extremely agreeable to read, but,
in the present improvement of classical taste, not so proper to be
imitated."&mdash;<cite>Life of Bathurst, prefixed to his Literary Remains, published

hawkers a plentiful assortment of wonders and prodigies to captivate
the people; with this difference, that, in that earlier period,
the readers and believers of these wonders were more numerous,
and of higher rank. I cannot point out the particular prodigies
referred to; but I suppose they were of the same description as
"The wonderful blazing star; with the dreadful apparition of
two armies in the air; the one out of the north, the other out of
the south, seen on the 17th December, 1680, betwixt four and
five o'clock in the evening, at Ottery, ten miles eastward of Exon;"
or as "The strange and dreadful relation of a horrible tempest of
thunder and lightning, and of strange apparitions in the air, accompanied
with whirlwinds, gusts of hail and rain, which happened
the 10th of June, 1680, at a place near Weatherby, in the
county of York: with the account how the top of strong oak,
containing one load of wood, was taken off by a sheet of fire, wrapped
in a whirlwind, and carried through the air, half a mile distant
from the place, &amp;c. As, likewise, another strange relation of
a monstrous child with two heads, four arms, four legs, and all
things thereunto belonging; born at a village, called Ill-Brewers,
in the county of Somerset, on the 19th of May last, with several
other circumstances and curious observations, to the wonder of
all that have beheld it."</p></div>

politicians, and busy bodies of the time. North says,
"It was observable of Oates, that while he had his liberty, as in
King Charles's time and King William's, especially the latter, he
never failed to give his attendance in the court of Requests, and in
the lobbies, to solicit hard in all points under deliberation that
might terminate in the prejudice of the church, crown, or of any
gentlemen of the loyal, or church of England party." Swift, in his
journal to Stella, makes frequent mention of the Court of Requests
as a scene of political bustle and intrigue.</p></div>

the City, Mayor, and Aldermen, for the sitting of parliament on the
13th January, 1680, which is printed with the city arms prefixed,
by a solemn order of the common council, and an appointment by
the Lord Mayor, that Samuel Roycroft, printer to the city, do
print the same, pursuant to order, and that no other person presume
to do so. The "factious speech" was probably that of
Shaftesbury, which was burned by the hands of the common

like the parliament, in 1641, against the king; and that the
audience judge as ill as those, who, in 1648, condemned Charles
to the block. The parallel between the political disputes in 1680,
and 1681, and those which preceded the great civil war, was
fashionable among the Tories. A Whig author, who undertakes
"to answer the clamours of the malicious, and to inform the ignorant
on this subject," complains, "It hath been all the clamour
of late, <em>forty-one</em>, <em>forty-one</em> is now coming to be acted over
again; we are running in the very same steps, in the same path
and road, to undo the nation, and to ruin kingly government, as
our predecessors did in <em>forty</em>, <em>and forty-one</em>. We run the same
courses, we take the same measures; <em>latet anguis in herba</em>; beware
of the Presbyterian serpent, who lurks in the affairs of <em>eighty</em>, being
the very same complexion, form, and shape, as that of forty
and forty one."&mdash;<em>The Disloyal Forty and Forty-one, and the Loyal
Eighty, presented to public view.</em> Folio 1680.</p></div>

crown, until they should obtain security, as they termed it, for

his "Strange and wonderful prophecy, being a relation of many
universal accidents that will come to pass in the year 1681, according
to the prognostications of the celestial bodies, as well in
this our English nation, as in parts beyond the seas, with a sober
caution to all, by speedy repentance, to avert the judgments that
are impendent," I find "an account of the great stream of light,
by some termed a blazing star, which was seen in the south-west
on Saturday and Sunday, the 11th and 12th of this instant December,
between six and seven in the evening, with several judicial
opinions and conjectures on the same." But the comet, mentioned
in the text, may be that which is noticed in "A strange and
wonderful Trinity, or a Triplicity of Stupendous Prodigies, consisting
of a wonderful eclipse, as well as of a wonderful comet, and
of a wonderful conjunction, now in its second return; seeing all
these three prodigious wonders do jointly portend wonderful
events, all meeting together in a strange harmonious triangle, and
are all the three royal heralds successively sent from the King of
Heaven, to sound succeeding alarms for awakening a slumbering
world. <cite>Beware the third time.</cite>" 4to. London, 1683. This comet
is said to have appeared in October 1682. Various interpretations
were put upon these heavenly phenomena, by Gadbury,
Lilly, Kirkby, Whalley, and other Philo-maths, who were chiefly
guided in their predictions by their political attachments. Some
insisted they meant civil war, others foreign conquest; some that
they presaged the downfall of the Turk, others that of the Pope
and French king; some that they foretold dearth on the land,
and others, the fertility of the king's bed, by the birth of a son, to
the exclusion of the Duke of York.</p></div>

Monmouth to strengthen his interest: "A relation was published,
in the name of one Elizabeth Freeman, afterwards called the
Maid of Hatfield, setting forth, That, on the 24th of January,
the appearance of a woman all in white, with a white veil over
her face, accosted her with these words: 'Sweetheart, the 15th
day of May is appointed for the royal blood to be poisoned. Be
not afraid, for I am sent to tell thee.' That on the 25th, the same
appearance stood before her again, and she having then acquired
courage enough to lay it under the usual adjuration, in the name,
&amp;c. it assumed a more glorious shape, and said in a harsher tone
of voice: 'Tell King Charles from me, and bid him not remove
his parliament, and stand to his council:' adding, 'do as I bid you.'
That on the 26th it appeared to her a third time, but said
only, 'do your message.' And that on the next night, when she saw
it for the last time, it said nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Those who depend upon the people for support, must try all
manners of practices upon them; and such fooleries as these sometimes
operate more forcibly than expedients of a more rational
kind. Care was, besides, taken, to have this relation attested by
Sir Joseph Jordan, a justice of the peace, and the rector of Hatfield,
Dr Lee, who was one of the king's chaplains: Nay, the
message was actually sent to his majesty, and the whole forgery
very officiously circulated all over the kingdom."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ralph's</span>

comedy of "The Lancashire Witches," in which a great deal of
machinery is introduced; the witches flying away with the clown's
candles, and the priest's bottle of holy water, and converting a
country-fellow into a horse upon the stage. Not content with
this, the author has introduced upon the stage all that writers
upon Dæmonology have rehearsed of the Witches' Sabbath, or Festival,
with their infernal master; and has thus, very clumsily,
mixed the horrible with the ludicrous. As for the cats and dogs,
we have, in one place,&mdash;"Enter an Imp, in the shape of a black
Shock;" and, in another,</p>

<p>"Enter Mother Hargrave, Mother Madge, and two Witches

<p>Besides the offence which Shadwell gave, in point of taste, by

towards those who dissented from the Roman Catholic
faith, occasioned several insurrections. The most memorable was
headed by Count Teckeli, who allied himself with the sultan, assumed
the crown of Transylvania, as a vassal of the Porte, and
joined, with a considerable force, the large army of Turks which
besieged Vienna, and threatened to annihilate the Austrian empire.
A similarity of situation and of interest induced the Whig
party in England to look with a favourable eye upon this Hungarian
insurgent, as may be fully inferred from the following passage
in De Foe's "Appeal to Honour and Justice:"</p>

<p>"The first time I had the misfortune to differ with my friends,
was about the year 1683, when the Turks were besieging Vienna,
and the Whigs in England, generally speaking, were for the Turks
taking it; which I, having read the history of the cruelty and
perfidious dealings of the Turks in their wars, and how they had
rooted out the name of the Christian religion in above threescore
and ten kingdoms, could by no means agree with; and, though
then but a young man, and a younger author, I opposed it, and
wrote against it, which was taken very unkindly indeed."</p>

<p>The incongruity of the opinion combated by De Foe, with the
high pretences of religion set up by the Whigs, was the constant
subject of ridicule to the Tory wits. In a poem, entitled, "The
Third Part of Advice to the Painter," dated by Luttrell 28th May,
1684, we find the following passage:</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i0">And their great prophet, Teckely, a quaking;</div>

  <div class="i0">That, to reform it, he brought in the Turk.</div>

<p>Another ballad, written shortly after the defeat of Monmouth, is
entitled, "A Song upon the Rendezvous on Hounsley-heath,
with a Parallel of the Destruction of our English Turks in the
West, and the Mahometans in Hungary." The expression occurs
also in the Address of the Carlisle Citizens on the Declaration of
Indulgence, who "thank his majesty for his royal army, which is
really both the honour and safety of the nation, let the Teckelites
think and say what they will." An indignant Whig commentator
on this effusion of loyalty, says, "What the good men of Carlisle
mean by Teckelites, we know not any more than they know themselves.
However, the word has a pretty effect at a time when
the Protestant Hungarians, under Count Teckely, were well beaten
by the Popish standing army in Hungary." <cite>History of Addresses</cite>,

and personal enemy, Shadwell. In the observations on
"Mac-Flecnoe," and elsewhere, we have noticed Shadwell's affectation
of treading in the paths of Ben Jonson, by describing what
he calls <em>humours</em>; a word as great a favourite with the fat bard as
with Corporal Nym. The following passage in the dedication of
"The Virtuoso," may serve to explain what he means by the
phrase:</p>

<p>"I have endeavoured in this play, at humour, wit, and satire,
which are the three things (however I may have fallen short in
my attempt) which your grace has often told me are the life of
a comedy. Four of the humours are entirely new; and, without
vanity, I may say I never produced a comedy that had not some
natural humour in it, not represented before, nor, I hope, ever
shall. Nor do I count those humours which a great many do;
that is to say, such as consist in using one or two by-words; or in
having a fantastic extravagant dress, as many pretended humours
have; nor in the affectation of some French words, which several
plays have shown us. I say nothing of impossible, unnatural,
farce fools, which some intend for comical; who think it the
easiest thing in the world to write a comedy, and yet will sooner
grow rich upon their ill plays than write a good one: Nor is
downright silly folly a humour, as some take it to be, for it is a
mere natural imperfection; and they might as well call it a humour
of blindness in a blind man, or lameness in a lame one; or
as a celebrated French farce has the humour of one who speaks
very fast, and of another who speaks very slow: But natural imperfections
are not fit subjects for comedy, since they are not to
be laughed at, but pitied. But the artificial folly of those who
are not coxcombs by nature, but, with great art and industry,
make themselves so, is a proper object of comedy; as I have
discoursed at large in the Preface to "The Humourists," written
five years since. Those slight circumstantial things, mentioned
before, are not enough to make a good comical humour; which
ought to be such an affectation as misguides men in knowledge,
art, or science; or that causes defection in manners and morality,
or perverts their minds in the main actions of their lives: And
this kind of humour, I think, I have not improperly described in
the Epilogue to "The Humourists."</p>

<p>"But your grace understands humour too well not to know this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and much more than I can say of it. All I have now to do, is,
humbly to dedicate this play to your grace, which has succeeded
beyond my expectation; and the humours of which have been
approved by men of the best sense and learning. Nor do I hear
of any professed enemies to the play, but some women, and some
men of feminine understandings, who like slight plays only that
represent a little tattle-sort of conversation like their own: but
true humour is not liked or understood by them; and therefore
even my attempt towards it is condemned by them: but the same
people, to my great comfort, damn all Mr Jonson's plays, who
was incomparably the best dramatic poet that ever was, or, I believe,
ever will be; and I had rather be author of one scene in
his best comedies, than of any play this age has produced."</p></div>

Revolution. I am not able to discover, if Shadwell had given any
very recent cause for this charge of plagiarism. In the "Libertine,"
"The Miser," "Bury-fair," and "The Sullen Lovers," he
has borrowed, or rather translated, from Moliere. The "Squire
of Alsatia" contains some imitations of Terence's "Adelphi."
"Psyche" is taken from the French, and "Timon of Athens"
from Shakespeare, although Shadwell has the assurance to claim
the merit of having made it into a play. He was also under obligations
to his contemporaries. The "Royal Shepherdess" was
originally written by one Mr Fountain of Devonshire. Dryden,
in "Mac-Flecnoe," intimates, that Sedley "larded with wit" his
play of "Epsom Wells;" and in the Dedication to the "True Widow,"
Shadwell himself acknowledges obligations to that gentleman's
revision of some of his pieces. Langbaine, who hated Dryden,
and professed an esteem for Shadwell, expresses himself thus,
on the latter's claim to originality:</p>

<p>"But I am willing to say the less of Mr Shadwell, because I
have publicly professed a friendship for him; and though it be
not of so long date as some former intimacy with others, so neither
is it blemished with some unhandsome dealings I have met
with from persons where I least expected it. I shall therefore
speak of him with the impartiality that becomes a critic, and
own I like his comedies better than Mr Dryden's, as having more
variety of characters, and those drawn from the life; I mean men's
converse and manners, and not from other men's ideas, copied out
of their public writings: though indeed I cannot wholly acquit
our present laureat from borrowing; his plagiaries being in some
places too bold and open to be disguised, of which I shall take notice,
as I go along; though with this remark, that several of them
are observed to my hand, and in great measure excused by himself,
in the public acknowledgment he makes in his several prefaces,
to the persons to whom he was obliged for what he borrowed."</p>

<p>Shadwell in the following lines, which occur in the prologue to
the "Scowerers," seems to retort on Dryden the accusation here
brought against him:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_408_409" id="Footnote_408_409"></a><a href="#FNanchor_408_409"><span class="label">[408]</span></a> Perhaps our author had in view the three oppositions of Saturn
and Jupiter in June and December 1692, and in April 1693,
which are thus feelingly descanted upon by John Silvester: "It
hath been long observed, that the most remarkable mutations of a
kingdom, or nation, have chiefly depended on the conjunctions or
aspects of those two superior planets, Saturn and Jupiter; and by
their effects past, we perceive that the most wise Creator first
placed them higher than all the other planets, that they should respect,
chiefly, the highest and most durable affairs and concerns of
men on earth.</p>

<p>"And if one opposition of Saturn and Jupiter produceth much,
how then can those three oppositions to come do any less than
cause some remarkable changes and alterations of laws, or religious
orders, in England's chief and most renowned city? because
Saturn then will be stronger than Jupiter, who also, at his second
opposition, will be near unto the body of Mars, (the planet of
war;) and having took possession of religious Jupiter, should
contend with him, (with a frowning lofty countenance,) in London's
ascendant, from whence I fear some religious disturbances,
if not some warlike violence, by insurrections, or otherwise, occasioned
by some frowning dissatisfied minds, which will then happen
in some part of Britain, or take its beginning there to the
purpose in those years.</p>

<p>"Ah poor Jupiter in Gemini! (London,) I fear thou wilt then
be so much humbled against thy will, that thou wilt think thou
hast a sufficient occasion to bewail thy condition; and if so, God
will suffer this, that thou mayest humbly endeavour to forsake thy
accustomed sins, and that thou mayest know power is not in thee
to help thyself. But yet I think thou wilt then have no need to
fear that God hath wholly forsaken thee; for look but a little
back unto the years 1682 and 1683, where Jupiter was three
times in conjunction with Saturn, in a sign of his own triplicity,
and consider, was not he then stronger than Saturn, and hast not
thou been victorious ever since, throughout all those great changes
and alterations? And when thou hast thus considered, perhaps
thou wilt believe, that that which begins well will end well; and
indeed perhaps it may so happen; but be not too proud of this, a
word is enough to the wise."&mdash;<cite>Astrological Observations and Predictions

"Aureng-Zebe," as the dedication is dated 26th June, 1676. The prologue
commences with an irreverend allusion to that play, and to our author's theatrical
engagements:</p>

attacks rhyming tragedies in general; the object of which diatribe,

<p>The passage in the Dedication, in which he insinuates that the provision of a
pension was all he wanted, to place him on a level with the proudest of his
rivals, is as follows: "That there are a great many faults in the conduct of
this play, I am not ignorant; but I (having no pension but from the theatre,
which is either unwilling, or unable, to reward a man sufficiently for so
much pains as correct comedies require) cannot allot my whole time to the
writing of plays, but am forced to mind some other business of advantage.
Had I as much money, and as much time for it, I might perhaps write as
correct a comedy as any of my contemporaries."</p></div>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
